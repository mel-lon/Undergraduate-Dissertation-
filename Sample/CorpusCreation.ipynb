      "Two years ago, while volunteering for a charity medical center, my dad was accused of trying to “be involved with” a woman volunteering there as well (he definitely wasn’t, she had previous accounts of anxiety that had manifested in that way.) The claims were groundless, and my mother was hurt, not by my father, who has always done his utmost to be clear and faithful, but by the allegations levied against him. Had this been a couple working to get their relationship right, or had my father been less trustworthy or my mother been less trusting, this would have damaged their relationship permanently. He left, and only recently returned since his accusers left. People seem to forget the nature of tabloids, rumors, and lies. Honest people, in honest relationships, are damaged and their relationships damaged/destroyed by falsifications raised against them. \n",

      "And the internet is no different. When Ninja speaks to the reality of clickbait, he isn’t speaking from a place of dead, but from a place of experience. Shock value and the best story is supposed to inevitably bring the most success, and what better story than bringing down the number 1 streamer? Regardless of anyone’s opinion about ninja, his level of success in the gaming medium makes him a target to those who would take advantage of the juiciest story. To say people won’t sell the news in a way that disrespects his life choices and love for his wife, are ignorant of the way the news/media/world works. I, personally, don’t see sexism in Ninja’s actions, because the decision he’s making is not merely to preserve his career, but to preserve the honor of the woman he loves. I don’t know this for sure, but given the flak he’s gotten for this, that he KNOWS he would have gotten for this, I’m fairly certain he is willing to give up a majority of his successes if it means his relationship with his wife remains healthily intact. \n",

      "I always reserve the right to be wrong. No one is perfect, especially on the internet, but if we want him to change his actions, the Twitch/Youtube community needs to move away from sensationalizing the personal lives of our entertainers the way previous generations have. It’s not his responsibility to fix the internet. It’s his responsibility to do right by his wife, though. Antroh: He really doesn't have much to worry about.

      "Two years ago, while volunteering for a charity medical center, my dad was accused of trying to “be involved with” a woman volunteering there as well (he definitely wasn’t, she had previous accounts of anxiety that had manifested in that way.) The claims were groundless, and my mother was hurt, not by my father, who has always done his utmost to be clear and faithful, but by the allegations levied against him. Had this been a couple working to get their relationship right, or had my father been less trustworthy or my mother been less trusting, this would have damaged their relationship permanently. He left, and only recently returned since his accusers left. People seem to forget the nature of tabloids, rumors, and lies. Honest people, in honest relationships, are damaged and their relationships damaged/destroyed by falsifications raised against them. \n",

      "And the internet is no different. When Ninja speaks to the reality of clickbait, he isn’t speaking from a place of dead, but from a place of experience. Shock value and the best story is supposed to inevitably bring the most success, and what better story than bringing down the number 1 streamer? Regardless of anyone’s opinion about ninja, his level of success in the gaming medium makes him a target to those who would take advantage of the juiciest story. To say people won’t sell the news in a way that disrespects his life choices and love for his wife, are ignorant of the way the news/media/world works. I, personally, don’t see sexism in Ninja’s actions, because the decision he’s making is not merely to preserve his career, but to preserve the honor of the woman he loves. I don’t know this for sure, but given the flak he’s gotten for this, that he KNOWS he would have gotten for this, I’m fairly certain he is willing to give up a majority of his successes if it means his relationship with his wife remains healthily intact. \n",

I graduated college a year ago and every dude I know plays it. I imagine that frat houses across the world are playing Fortnite. It’s not just a boom among teenagers, it’s a boom for lots of people. It’s the most popular video game in the world.  ethicalstreamer: When I ask my nephews who are 11 and 7, what are all the kids playing in school, they said Fortnite... For any video game to have that big of a reach to kids this young, I think its pretty impressive.  I also think its interesting that when I was watching one of them check out youtube, they were lookin at Fortnite videos to which the people kept talking about people with SKINS vs With out.. that right there is extremely interesting that its even in the mindset of the kids....

Mantic really went above and beyond to ensure the Old World Refugees had a place to play, and have rules written for every one of WH:FB's proxy armies and units.

      "Tom dealt with the death wave the only way you really can - by ignoring it.  For those who don't know, the death wave is caused because the cims of this game have a fairly uniform life span (I believe it's about six years long), and they only die if they're either killed in a disaster, left to die through very low healthcare levels, or they die of old age.  If they die of old age, they ALL die of old age at pretty much the same time, as they moved in at the same time and technically at the same age.  There's two ways of getting rid of the death wave.  Either you build exceptionally slowly and run the time forward on fast speed for a while between building sessions, or you can download various mods that can provide a better variance of lifespans for your cims, killing off some earlier and some later.  I can't recommend one mod in particular as I don't know which mods Tom has installed, and if I remember rightly it's possible these mods can break your game a bit in some circumstances.\n",

I did watch the previous video despite the explicit warning not to; I feel slightly dirty.

      "I prefer more editing.  It does not have to be North Side High levels of editing.  I know this will mean shorter or less frequent videos, but youtube is full of low effort lets plays.  What drew me to Tom is his editing.  I know minutes watched is the big deal on youtube now, but I think all these youtubers that throw a low effort \"completes\" series for easy minute viewed is not the answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stand out Tom. ptatoface: Tom, I don't know if you've been made aware of this since recording, but the tethers are a crucial part of the game that you're missing out on. To use them, all you have to do is put them in your inventory (not in the special slot that you put solar panels in) and press T to place them. Place the first one close enough to the base that you see a blue \"oxygen wire\" connected to it from the base. Then, you can connect a second tether to the first, a third to the second, and so on until you have a chain of them. If they're all connected, they should provide with oxygen (and energy if your base has it) in the same way that your base does. Basically, it means that you can explore for more than 20 seconds before having to run back to base for oxygen.\n",

      "On the question of editing, I think that it isn't really needed very much when playing multiplayer, and can be cut down a bit in singleplayer. For example, I personally wouldn't mind that much if you didn't do the thing where you show a picture of something whenever you say it, like trains in the recent Cities: Skylines episodes. mr_mallen: I'm probably echoing most peoples comments on youtube and reddit - prefer the highly editted because it sets tom apart but both styles are welcome. \n",
      "Another thing i'm really liking is that tom is working hard to make his viewers a part of his channel. I hope he keeps this going as his channel grows. The_WubWub: With this series since it is so multiplayer focus I do not mind less editing as the multiplayer is an effort in itself. More single player focused I love the editing that is currently on your channel. AngMod: I agree with you there.

      "Tom dealt with the death wave the only way you really can - by ignoring it.  For those who don't know, the death wave is caused because the cims of this game have a fairly uniform life span (I believe it's about six years long), and they only die if they're either killed in a disaster, left to die through very low healthcare levels, or they die of old age.  If they die of old age, they ALL die of old age at pretty much the same time, as they moved in at the same time and technically at the same age.  There's two ways of getting rid of the death wave.  Either you build exceptionally slowly and run the time forward on fast speed for a while between building sessions, or you can download various mods that can provide a better variance of lifespans for your cims, killing off some earlier and some later.  I can't recommend one mod in particular as I don't know which mods Tom has installed, and if I remember rightly it's possible these mods can break your game a bit in some circumstances.\n",

A cautionary tale. roshdroz: Personally I think he's simply a young and new musician, still discovering the messages he wants to make, and when and where to make them. I agree with your observation about some songs having more meaning in their lyrics. After hearing saintlike, I'm convinced that he has a real knack for lyricism and we can probably expect much bigger things to come. So to sort of answer your question, I think his future music is probably going to clear this up for you, and carry some more meaning, more consistently. BayadOfficial: Saintlike is 100% about Jacob. I think the whole chorus was some sort of metaphor for his career/audience/idek but as a female. Many artists do this. Eminem puts \"hiphop\" into the character of a woman in 25 to life, for example. Taking it slow could mean he doesn't want to rush his career and success, but instead really connect with what he's creating. Thus, he's getting \"her\" mind' from subreddit: NakeyJakey\n",

Like it seems like it's meant to be funny, but some of the lyrics near the end make me think it has some sort of deeper meaning. sasiawastaken: I don't know about the first question, but I'm pretty sure Saintlike is a serious song with some comedic parts, I think it's about what he did and how he felt before he realized he wanted to be someone special TheBigDogYT: If Dead Friends is still the same album Jakey referenced 2 years ago in \"channel update and album preview\" and even some videos before that, then probably for 2, maybe 2 and a half years? It will probably feature the 4 or 5 tracks hes published since then, and then a bunch more. Also I think Saintlike was made in the same vane as Jakeys videos, the comedy helps carry along his overarching message or point. The point being in saintlike, at least to me, the struggle of being a small creator, in any sense, and the way it can bring you down or hinder your own creativity.

It's a constant territory war where the aliens have to spread their infection across the entire facility, and the humans have to try and wipe it out entirely. As their infection spreads, it will knock out power and such, meaning that human areas are nicely lit with functioning facilities (because that's what humans need), whereas alien areas are dark and covered in gross slimey growths that make human traversal harder. In either area the enemy team feels out of their comfort zone.\n",

      "Dead Space is a third person action horror game series not unalike Resident Evil 4 and 5, also set in futurey sci-fi places. Weird alien artifacts turn humans into gross monsters called necromorphs, that further spread by killing and turning humans. It's a tense game that keeps you on your toes at all moments (except maybe the third one). It features a diverse and iconic enemy (the necromorphs) that could easily serve in place of the Kharaa (alien bad dudes in Natural Selection), and creative weapons that differentiate themselves from standard shooters with their unique purposes and designs. The weapons aren't simply meant to kill, they're meant to dismember the necromorphs, so it requires knowledge of all necromorph's weakpoints to chop them into little bits with as few shots as possible.\n",

      "Think about it, the gameplay of Natural Selection 2 but with a team of undead gamer girls vs plasma cutter wielding hot boys. There's already a Dead Space multiplayer gamemode that allows people to play as necromorphs, so it's already been proven there's enough variety in necromorph morphology (necromorphology?) to constitute different classes. A battle for a ship like the Ishimura between the forces of the Marker and Earthgov (even though they kinda built the second marker? whatever). The human team uses all the repurposed tools Isaac has access to in the single player (also using power nodes as a form of currency to upgrade said tools) and the different RIG suits (Security, Engineer, Triage, etc.) can constitute the different classes. The necromorph team has all the different evolutions of necromorphs to play as. Slashers are standard brutes who can use vents and their incredible speed to close the gap with human players. Infectors are weak and require stealth but can turn human corpses into one time use spawn points for slasher players. Pukers are standard range that can spec their puke into multiple effects such as their default slow effect. Cysts and Guardians act as land mines and sentry turrets for the necromorph team respectively. The Pack are a weak melee class but could receive additional movement based abilities or buffs to their stats when playing close to other Pack players (like an actual Pack would). Brutes would be a standard tank class, encouraging human players to aim for the weakpoints as they would in the singleplayer game. The Ubermorph could even act as a miniboss class like the Tank from L4D2's versus mode or the Onos from Natural Selection. Just as in the singleplayer, power nodes could also instead be used to open locked off areas, or power facilities such as automated defenses, making a player really think about how they should use these precious nodes. I know that this already far fetched idea is made even more distant by the disbanding of Visceral Games, but...\n",

      "Characters are written in such a way that the tropes they seem like at the beginning are never the full story; the game tackles really mature topics while not becoming a gritty gritfest that takes itself too seriously; the way the more narritively driven life as an animu schoolboi is interwoven with the more systems driven turn based combat is genius - it actually baffles me that other games are so seperated in that regard, because youre used to stopping one to do the other and vice versa; the music is phantastic; the UI is super styleish and has so much character; the world is packed with quality interactions and changes throughout the game, so visiting spots you haven't been to in a while is worth it; and also just the sheer concept of the game is utterly unique.\n",

The presentation of Persona 5 is beyond words, the UI is flashy, the soundtrack (like P3 &amp; P4) is a gem, the combat (unlike P3 &amp; P4) is actually fun, the characters are unique and bring thier own weight to the narrative, I could go on, but we would be here for hours.

Card games have a huge player base. Card games can be enjoyed by non-gamers and by cuthroat competitive gamers alike.\n",

      "It is a matter of preference, I get it. I just think its dishonest saying 'Valve doesn't make games anymore.' I hear this repeated all the time on reddit and it pisses me off. Valve just fell in love with competitive gaming, so they're making games in that genre. And that's ok. spacejam_onbluray: old enough to know better  spacejam_onbluray: i feel like his attention isn't on the quantity of the games being produced, but the quality and direction the company is going\n",

      "there is one thing, however, that some of their other franchises (Half-life, Portal, Team Fortress, Etc.) possess that CS and DOTA do not; spirit and personality.

A cautionary tale. roshdroz: Personally I think he's simply a young and new musician, still discovering the messages he wants to make, and when and where to make them. I agree with your observation about some songs having more meaning in their lyrics. After hearing saintlike, I'm convinced that he has a real knack for lyricism and we can probably expect much bigger things to come. So to sort of answer your question, I think his future music is probably going to clear this up for you, and carry some more meaning, more consistently. BayadOfficial: Saintlike is 100% about Jacob. I think the whole chorus was some sort of metaphor for his career/audience/idek but as a female. Many artists do this. Eminem puts \"hiphop\" into the character of a woman in 25 to life, for example. Taking it slow could mean he doesn't want to rush his career and success, but instead really connect with what he's creating. Thus, he's getting \"her\" mind' from subreddit: NakeyJakey\n",

Then they finally told me that my order never got sent out because the 'Lanes Tee' was sold out??? somehow it was sold out, but when i bought it, it didnt say sold out?? so they refunded me for shipping and for the 'Lanes Tee'. Great. they said that the poki shirts should leave the warehouse the day they send me their response email. now i see on the tracking it says i should receive my poki merch on monday april 30th.... over a month since i placed the order......the worst part was that a couple days after i placed the order they sent the tracking number and it said preshipment meaning they shippers were waiting for the product. and it was left on pre shipment for like 2-3 weeks until i sent that nasty email. unlockss: East Coast, i ordered 2 poki shirts and a Lanes Tee which was not sold out when i bought it and they didnt tell me that they ran out after i bought it which is why they just gave me the shit end of the stick' from subreddit: Pokimane\n",

      "- Like any FPS, aiming is KEY. This will happen as you play more and expose yourself to this game and shoot people. It takes time to get accustomed. Low mouse sensitivity will help you aim better, especially when you are new to FPS.\n",
      "- Building is not as hard as people make it to be and I feel that this is something you will grasp easily. When you play squad, hack down trees and stuff and just practice building walls and ramps around you while there’s no shooting!

      "+ When you get shot, on your screen you will see a blue mark for shield or a red mark for health appear. It will generally be off the centre. This will point you where you are getting shot from. So if the mark appears towards the bottom part, it means it from behind you. If it’s towards the top, in front of you. This will give you a general idea of your enemy. \n",
      "+ Once you get shot, you want to build wall around you to prevent more bullets from hitting you and getting some cover. Generally you want to spin 360 and spam your wall. You want to get yourself surrounded by 4 walls for cover and the a ramp inside to potentially fight back.\n",

      " maartenxq: The world changes so do people. She stayed as happy as she always was, which is probably the most important. Xourr: I think she’s strayed away from her community a bit, although I think you’re exaggerating. It’s difficult for streamers to maintain a personal connection with their viewers with a viewership as large as hers. It’s the same with summit, for instance. Amazing guy, great streams, but chat is moving so fast and there’s so many donations and subs that it’s impossible for him to maintain connection with his viewers. At the end of the day, this is still her job, it’s how she earns a living and she has to look out for herself first. Perhaps she’s starting to go a little overboard, perhaps OfflineTV is pushing her into this style. Who knows.  Kobdzio: While I kinda understand your problem with ads I can't agree with the only for money/donations reactions :/ let's be real here. The amout of growth poki's experienced over the past few months is insane. Chat moves at lightning speed and it's almost impossible to read everything. That's how it works. Your creator's get the success you've probably always wanted them to have but they are not gonna pay attention to everyone. I personally love IRL streams and I tune in everytime ^_^ I even prefer them over League content LUL.\n",
      " Boopdoop27: Yea I agree. I use to love her streams when she was like 1k-2k viewers, now I hardly watch at all because I just don't enjoy it anymore. I'm happy for her with how much she has grown, and clearly a lot of other people like her new style, I just personally don't. And I don't think she will be going back anytime soon =( Boopdoop27: Summit hardly does sellout streams though. Plus he uses sub mode a lot which would probably help with what op is talking about. But that's up to poki and how she wants to see her chat Xourr: The difference here being summit is big enough that he doesn’t need to go into sellout mode. He is way past the point of counting subs and donations. Poki’s donations, subs, and viewership are not nearly big enough for that. Alternatively, poki has reached the viewership count to where it’s nearly impossible to establish meaningful connections with her viewers.  Boopdoop27: &gt;The difference here being summit is big enough that he doesn’t need to go into sellout mode. \n",
      "\n",
      "So what poki isnt? That's just not true at all. She might not be loosing track of subs and donations like him, but she definitely makes an insane amount from them alone. I think it's a bit of a stretch to say she needs to go into sellout mode. I understand her not interacting with viewers as much though. Especially with how big she has gotten, that's fine, and should honestly be expected. I just mentioned sub mode because it seems like a good way to get some interaction in when you grow to a certain point Xourr: You are either vastly underestimating how much money summit makes or vastly overestimating how much money poki makes. Obviously she doesn’t need sellout mode to live comfortably. But why live comfortably when you can do so much more? Boopdoop27: I don't think they are comparable amounts, they're not. And she is already living more than comfortably I'd bet, but that's not the point. She can keep doing sellout streams and reaction clips for the youtubers if she want to keep making more money, it's her stream after all. But I don't think it's wrong for me to say I don't enjoy that type of content just because I use to like her streams  Xourr: No one said you were wrong for disliking that type of content.  Boopdoop27: Great, then we are on the same page.  SoulStealerThresh: I like noodles. MarvelousMaverickk: TBH, I don't watch her stream anymore. The problem as anyone knows is that when a streamer has over 10K viewers like she has it becomes difficult for her to connect with her subs and followers. I wish her all the success in the world but she will have to figure it out on how to deal with all of her success because when you lose the connection you have with your subs and followers I would think for her it starts to lose meaning, unless of course all she cares about is the money, and of course that is up to her.

      "\n",
      "Poki ALWAYS thanks each every subscriber and donator on her stream.\n",

      "I noticed after being on her stream for awhile that she has very strong morals. I think that is good. A moral person is a good person.\n",

      "\n",
      "She's a good communicator because she knows how to use her voice tone and body expression to get her points across. (She may not be aware of this, but I have noticed it)\n",
      "\n",
      "If you have watched Poki on her  stream for at least a little while you would definitely conclude that she wouldn't hurt a fly. Certainly, not on purpose. I know she's not perfect, but she is a good person.\n",
      " \n",

Can you forgive someone for their behavior and have them back?

TeepEU: I did, all Jack says is that the friend-zone should be an indication to move on from the person who friend-zoned you. Which is the same way that Poki uses it? Kobdzio: Yes, but he air quotes the phrase \"friendzone\" because it's ridiculous. It rejects the idea of a friendship with an opposite gender. I don't see it as a funny thing to say :/ for me it just shows how men are portrayed by society. Maybe it's just my problem but a lot of people don't even understand the problem with \"friendzone\" xd and I've seen plenty of discussions on the internet. You can dive into the topic yourself. TeepEU: friendzone doesn't deny the idea of a friendship with the opposite gender, it's specifically for when one of two parties would want to date, whereas the other just wants to be friends. Kobdzio: I dont think I'm qualified enough to convince you that the problem with the friendzone is more than just a silly relationship with a  girl that doesn't feel the same way xd as I said before there are a lot of discussions on the internet on the topic.

      " maartenxq: The world changes so do people. She stayed as happy as she always was, which is probably the most important. Xourr: I think she’s strayed away from her community a bit, although I think you’re exaggerating. It’s difficult for streamers to maintain a personal connection with their viewers with a viewership as large as hers. It’s the same with summit, for instance. Amazing guy, great streams, but chat is moving so fast and there’s so many donations and subs that it’s impossible for him to maintain connection with his viewers. At the end of the day, this is still her job, it’s how she earns a living and she has to look out for herself first. Perhaps she’s starting to go a little overboard, perhaps OfflineTV is pushing her into this style. Who knows.  Kobdzio: While I kinda understand your problem with ads I can't agree with the only for money/donations reactions :/ let's be real here. The amout of growth poki's experienced over the past few months is insane. Chat moves at lightning speed and it's almost impossible to read everything. That's how it works. Your creator's get the success you've probably always wanted them to have but they are not gonna pay attention to everyone. I personally love IRL streams and I tune in everytime ^_^ I even prefer them over League content LUL.\n",
      " Boopdoop27: Yea I agree. I use to love her streams when she was like 1k-2k viewers, now I hardly watch at all because I just don't enjoy it anymore. I'm happy for her with how much she has grown, and clearly a lot of other people like her new style, I just personally don't. And I don't think she will be going back anytime soon =( Boopdoop27: Summit hardly does sellout streams though. Plus he uses sub mode a lot which would probably help with what op is talking about. But that's up to poki and how she wants to see her chat Xourr: The difference here being summit is big enough that he doesn’t need to go into sellout mode. He is way past the point of counting subs and donations. Poki’s donations, subs, and viewership are not nearly big enough for that. Alternatively, poki has reached the viewership count to where it’s nearly impossible to establish meaningful connections with her viewers.  Boopdoop27: &gt;The difference here being summit is big enough that he doesn’t need to go into sellout mode. \n",
      "\n",
      "So what poki isnt? That's just not true at all. She might not be loosing track of subs and donations like him, but she definitely makes an insane amount from them alone. I think it's a bit of a stretch to say she needs to go into sellout mode. I understand her not interacting with viewers as much though. Especially with how big she has gotten, that's fine, and should honestly be expected. I just mentioned sub mode because it seems like a good way to get some interaction in when you grow to a certain point Xourr: You are either vastly underestimating how much money summit makes or vastly overestimating how much money poki makes. Obviously she doesn’t need sellout mode to live comfortably. But why live comfortably when you can do so much more? Boopdoop27: I don't think they are comparable amounts, they're not. And she is already living more than comfortably I'd bet, but that's not the point. She can keep doing sellout streams and reaction clips for the youtubers if she want to keep making more money, it's her stream after all. But I don't think it's wrong for me to say I don't enjoy that type of content just because I use to like her streams  Xourr: No one said you were wrong for disliking that type of content.  Boopdoop27: Great, then we are on the same page.  SoulStealerThresh: I like noodles. MarvelousMaverickk: TBH, I don't watch her stream anymore. The problem as anyone knows is that when a streamer has over 10K viewers like she has it becomes difficult for her to connect with her subs and followers. I wish her all the success in the world but she will have to figure it out on how to deal with all of her success because when you lose the connection you have with your subs and followers I would think for her it starts to lose meaning, unless of course all she cares about is the money, and of course that is up to her.

GTAman51: Can you help me understand why are you here if you're not a fan?  tenkini: Can you help me understand how to type? :( Blindobb: Because I find it fascinating that someone like this hasn't been banned considering her blatant sexualisation as a core part of her content, revealing clothing, and low effort streams, and still seems to have a really dedicated fanbase regardless of whether she has any talent or not and is based on looks alone.  I think it's a really good question you have though and I don't have a real answer for you.  I know I'm not alone and that it's a pretty common phenomenon that people watch stuff they don't exactly love.\n",

It's not like I lurk in her chat 24/7 but any time I find myself there, so are you. npw39487w3pregih: i kinda get the hate too, but \"low effort\" is ridiculous, clearly nobody is working harder moosetiger: it’s cuz she’s hot vegandawg: Talent? You serious? Who has talent on twitch? It's a bunch of personalities.... Find it strange people watch DrDisrespect but can understand why people like Amouranth.  Blindobb: I mean Twitch is primarily a place for video game streaming and he’s actually good at video games. That along with his incredibly high effort streams with professional graphic design and an incredibly deep streamlab overlay, he has an original character that he created and doesn’t just spout dead memes and dance for subs or donations, which is pathetic and really close to being a modest stripper by the way, is probably why he pulls in 10 times the amount of viewers amouranth has. If you are going to try to compare streams he isn’t a good one to pick. Say what you want about his personal life or who he is as a person but the quality and effort put into his stream is indisputable. People may not like him but my girlfriend doesn’t like Breaking Bad but that doesn’t mean it’s a bad show. It means she is a tasteless bitch.  vegandawg: Well we'll have to agree to disagree there. I personally find an attractive girl with a super hero body to be more \"art\" than some douchebag trying to ironically look like a 80's metal personality and playing boring video games. She does more than dance around and recently does stuff with an asmr mic. There's no accounting for taste afterall though. Personally I love breaking bad as well and my wife hates it too. Don't watch amouranth much (probably watch world of tanks streamers more than her) but hard to dismiss her as a \"modest stripper\". Do you think the same of say STPeach? Is something wrong with a gal dressing in such a way that appeals to her target audience? Isn't that what DrDisrespect does with his getup?' from subreddit: Amouranth\n",
      "Selected utterance: 'propstoammo: I'm a female streamer on Twitch and heard about certain streamers such as Amouranth.  I had a lot of negative feelings towards her and other female streamers on Twitch for the type of streaming they do.  Then with an open mind, I popped into one of Ammo's streams.  There is no doubt, she is beautiful.  To my surprise she is also talented.  She has an amazing voice when she sings, and her paintings are amazing.  She always has a smile and her ASMR has turned me into an ASMR fan.  She also works her butt off.  I can't believe how many hours she streams and all the work she puts into it.  She is so much more than a pretty face and rockin body.  I'm glad I gave her a chance.   TheCop03: That's the sad part. I genuinely believe she could have been a more popular steamer if she didn't do all her side dealings like that. She's an amazing streamer with great content but a lot of viewers doesnt watch her streams because of her other side ( including me to some extent). amouranth: \\&lt;33 real_dyeoxyde: Awesome to hear! I always encourage people to stick around and get to know her. I know how she comes off to a lot of people, glad you stuck around, I hope to see you in chat. &lt;3 duxbelorum28: Awesome that s great to read you gave her a chance and enjoy Ammo s streams AoM336: Whats this?

      "Those are awesome things to say, welcome to the FAM! Chiakiichan: i found her through a gossip forum but i didnt even come to trash her i was just curious where all this hate come from. after a couple hours i followed because she is really entertaining and i dont understand the hate, probably jealous girls. im a girl too and we should uplift each other not hate Sowlid: IKR people make a wrong idea just because some streamers do the typical things for more viewers but Ammouranth nah she is really cool and entertainment I really love her streams she is so talent as you say her paints are so good blackXsquid: New to her, what \"other side\"? TheCop03: Go look her up on patreon. You'll know what I'm talking about. Break_Bot72: Unfortunately the female hate demographic only makes up a portion of the whingers on that site \\(and just about everywhere to be fair\\). It doesn't take too much effort to find videos on youtube discussing the \"thot problem on twitch\" from the perspective of quite conservative types, that use the \"won't someone think of the children\" angle, as well as trying to make the whole thing into a selling of sexuality debate \\(I bet these idiots want all woman to dress like they do in the Handmaids Tale, because showing a little knee is an open invitation probably\\) \\- Ammo has been an easy target for them, so no wonder her name comes up in discussions. If anything, I've only seen her channel go from strength to strength since I started watching, and although I'm not massively into ASMR and the dancing, there is more than enough to keep me engaged when I do tune in, so for these people to point fingers and miss that she actually does have content that her followers like \\(and that there is a reason why she has a successful channel\\) displays nothing more than their own inhibitions and judgmental nature. Thankfully voices of positivity, much like your post, tend to drown out the negative arseholes that are out there, which not only makes her channel a better place for viewers, but I'm sure it rubs off on her too \\(makes it all the more worthwhile when people like what you do, I assume\\). Captainweirdo54: Shes a fucking titty streamer those two speed humps are the only reason people watch her why do you think she draws in up to 2000 viewers just sitting in front on a backdrop with a low cut top on chatting shit?' from subreddit: Amouranth\n",

GTAman51: Can you help me understand why are you here if you're not a fan?  tenkini: Can you help me understand how to type? :( Blindobb: Because I find it fascinating that someone like this hasn't been banned considering her blatant sexualisation as a core part of her content, revealing clothing, and low effort streams, and still seems to have a really dedicated fanbase regardless of whether she has any talent or not and is based on looks alone.  I think it's a really good question you have though and I don't have a real answer for you.

You serious? Who has talent on twitch? It's a bunch of personalities.... Find it strange people watch DrDisrespect but can understand why people like Amouranth.  Blindobb: I mean Twitch is primarily a place for video game streaming and he’s actually good at video games. That along with his incredibly high effort streams with professional graphic design and an incredibly deep streamlab overlay, he has an original character that he created and doesn’t just spout dead memes and dance for subs or donations, which is pathetic and really close to being a modest stripper by the way, is probably why he pulls in 10 times the amount of viewers amouranth has. If you are going to try to compare streams he isn’t a good one to pick. Say what you want about his personal life or who he is as a person but the quality and effort put into his stream is indisputable. People may not like him but my girlfriend doesn’t like Breaking Bad but that doesn’t mean it’s a bad show. It means she is a tasteless bitch.  vegandawg: Well we'll have to agree to disagree there. I personally find an attractive girl with a super hero body to be more \"art\" than some douchebag trying to ironically look like a 80's metal personality and playing boring video games. She does more than dance around and recently does stuff with an asmr mic. There's no accounting for taste afterall though. Personally I love breaking bad as well and my wife hates it too. Don't watch amouranth much (probably watch world of tanks streamers more than her) but hard to dismiss her as a \"modest stripper\". Do you think the same of say STPeach? Is something wrong with a gal dressing in such a way that appeals to her target audience? Isn't that what DrDisrespect does with his getup?' from subreddit: Amouranth\n",

I had a lot of negative feelings towards her and other female streamers on Twitch for the type of streaming they do.  Then with an open mind, I popped into one of Ammo's streams.  There is no doubt, she is beautiful.  To my surprise she is also talented.  She has an amazing voice when she sings, and her paintings are amazing.  She always has a smile and her ASMR has turned me into an ASMR fan.  She also works her butt off.  I can't believe how many hours she streams and all the work she puts into it.  She is so much more than a pretty face and rockin body.  I'm glad I gave her a chance.   TheCop03: That's the sad part. I genuinely believe she could have been a more popular steamer if she didn't do all her side dealings like that. She's an amazing streamer with great content but a lot of viewers doesnt watch her streams because of her other side ( including me to some extent). amouranth: \\&lt;33 real_dyeoxyde: Awesome to hear!

Chiakiichan: i found her through a gossip forum but i didnt even come to trash her i was just curious where all this hate come from. after a couple hours i followed because she is really entertaining and i dont understand the hate, probably jealous girls. im a girl too and we should uplift each other not hate Sowlid: IKR people make a wrong idea just because some streamers do the typical things for more viewers but Ammouranth nah she is really cool and entertainment I really love her streams she is so talent as you say her paints are so good blackXsquid: New to her, what \"other side\"? TheCop03: Go look her up on patreon. You'll know what I'm talking about. Break_Bot72: Unfortunately the female hate demographic only makes up a portion of the whingers on that site \\(and just about everywhere to be fair\\). It doesn't take too much effort to find videos on youtube discussing the \"thot problem on twitch\" from the perspective of quite conservative types, that use the \"won't someone think of the children\" angle, as well as trying to make the whole thing into a selling of sexuality debate \\(I bet these idiots want all woman to dress like they do in the Handmaids Tale, because showing a little knee is an open invitation probably\\) \\- Ammo has been an easy target for them, so no wonder her name comes up in discussions. If anything, I've only seen her channel go from strength to strength since I started watching, and although I'm not massively into ASMR and the dancing, there is more than enough to keep me engaged when I do tune in, so for these people to point fingers and miss that she actually does have content that her followers like \\(and that there is a reason why she has a successful channel\\) displays nothing more than their own inhibitions and judgmental nature. Thankfully voices of positivity, much like your post, tend to drown out the negative arseholes that are out there, which not only makes her channel a better place for viewers, but I'm sure it rubs off on her too \\(makes it all the more worthwhile when people like what you do, I assume\\).

While MrRepzion is presumably of the opinion that most or all of the incidents involving Lea have been intentional on her part, the fact remains that she claims otherwise, and thus Lea receiving a temporary ban does not necessarily constitute a double standard on Twitch's part unless Twitch likewise disbelieves her.\n",
      "\n",
      "More generally, he seems to view anything short of a permanent ban as a \"slap on the wrist\", probably because he considers a temporary ban of any duration unlikely to meaningfully impact any streamer's behavior. And more importantly to the particular case of Lea, he fails to even address her claim that the incident was accidental. Presumably he considers that claim so blatantly unbelievable, particularly in light of her lengthy history of approaching the limits of the rules, as to be unworthy of any consideration. However, by so doing he also fails to address Twitch's responsibility as the authority figure in the situation to give that claim at least some consideration, lest they inevitably be accused of unfairness toward another streamer who likewise claims an incident was accidental, such as Genietfan as I mentioned earlier.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now to be fair, I was unable to personally verify whether Twitch has in fact ever permanently banned anyone, and as such it is possible that he's correct in the respect that Twitch also has a history of administering permanent bans to a streamers who claim that an incident was accidental. In that case, his overall position and accusation of double standards would carry more weight. That, however, would conversely render his failure to even address the issue of Twitch's response to allegedly accidental incidents even more problematic, and in light of his decision to ignore accidental incidents altogether I find it somewhat less likely that he is substantially more familiar than I with evidence of Twitch's overall pattern of responses to intentional as opposed to non-intentional incidents.\n",
      "\n",
      "He may have a point, and it is certainly possible that Twitch has on the whole displayed a double standard with regards to administering permanent bans exclusively to less popular streamers, but he provides no evidence of that accusation beyond general references to an unspecified number of unidentified banned streamers and the specific case of Lea herself, and as such reduces his argument to little more than his own preconception regarding Twitch's pattern of permanent bans.' from subreddit: legendarylea\n",

She'll face her 30 day suspension, come back, more shit will happen and nothing will come of it. Twitch has this real beauty double standard for people they like and people they don't care for, if this happened to any other streamer they would have already been perm banned no question. Reckful shows a bullshit gif that turns into porn by accident and gets 7 days, lea shows her pussy and gets 30 days? makes no sense.  fruitbooploops: holy shit you are so cringey StaffTroll: She is just 30 day banned ;) dinkblagger: Yeah hitbox.tv or even youtube gaming is starting to look a lot fucking better, I tolerate most people but feminazis don't make that list and I already got off twitter to get away from the legbeards. NevyTheChemist: Her beef curtains. Riposte_This: It's not a criminal offense, it is civil.  PESH28: I cannot work out how Twitch bans. Some notably toxic cancerous streamers, including one who goes into the streamers of female streamers to talk thrash, are completely ban free.  I hope Lea at least buys a pair of knicker for when she next streams. Sloop_Pilot: But in his last youtube video he said that it was a lie? So therefore it is slander. I think I agree with the point you are making in that they shouldn't have banned him because it was not actually proven he was defaming, but in the end it was true he was defaming. Sloop_Pilot: I agree that it was quite a, for lack of better words, 'dick move' to do that.

Vorlax: someone explain to me why yall hate her? never watched her streams so the hate seems unwarranted from here ExCinisCineris: Her saying all kids with cancer are meant to die, her getting away with multiple ToS infractions that most other people would be banned for and, for her being an insufferable cunt on twitter. Also this is just in the last two months there is a lot more of you keep looking. Vorlax: OH SHIT THIS IS THE BITCH THAT SAID THE CANCER THING? FUCK THAT HOE Fixateyo: also - rito games Fogcityroller: Brief nudity is just as bad as harassing someone and publicizing personal information. Good job reddit! crystalblooo: The guy got on his knees on a chat with the twitch admins and begged them to keep his channel up and give him a chance. If they even knew Ali they'd know he's genuine and would change immediately, twitch was legitimately his life and he loved it. He just tends to get emotional and invested and said the wrong thing in the moment.

You're interpretation of what I said is pretty far off. Seems like you just like to find ways to justify you're retarded views about politics. Skydogg5555: Yeah we all should revert to the stone ages and be naked wherever we are, good idea! Skydogg5555: If you think people who disagree with seeing nudity on a gaming platform meant for gaming purposes and nothing else, you must not know the definition of pornography. There is a difference between covering yourself out of respect for others, and it inherently being a bad thing. No one here is some sort of astroturfer looking for political gain. TrailOfTearsAndLulzz: no the mere fact that one would be expected to cover oneself \"out of respect\" for others sort of inherently applies that the human body is inherently a bad thing and frankly i simply don't see any way around that.\n",

TrailOfTearsAndLulzz: well you mentioned governments around the world having laws as if that somehow means that it's \"right\" or \"moral\" or whatever. i mean there are LOTS of governments around the world that have some pretty horrible policies from a human rights point of view. you wouldnt want to live in those places, im sure. so it seems a bit silly and off the point to even point out that those places have such laws because it's totally meaningless to the convo.\n",

Skydogg5555: I think the human body is a marvelous result of evolution through natural selection, I have no reason to be insecure about my body, if someone has dedicated the time and effort into their body, I celebrate that fact. I am not religious, I simply disagree with your viewpoint because it's obviously flawed and seems to stem from bigotry. The fact of the matter is, this discussion is pointless and your post is pointless. People have different opinions on nudity, and you aren't going to change it, no matter if it's right or wrong to \"cover\" yourself. My opinion is, there is a time and place for nudity, just like everything else. Skydogg5555: I don't really see how you would know what's right or moral, what exactly are you basing it on? I used a fairly valid example which is that most developed countries have in place laws against public nudity, can I not conclude that these laws are in place for a good reason?

Skydogg5555: I'm going to end this absurd excuse for a argument, good luck in the future with whatever it is you're trying to accomplish.

Calm your tits and leave the girl alone if you don't like her choice with taking a break from streaming then leave. Holydonus: if this gets 10 upvotes I'll kill myself aegisz: Virgin WhiteKnight detected ^ haha Lawwwy: I actually have had a girlfriend for 3 years :) Not a whiteknight just not begging for twitch pussy on the internet and being upset when I don't get it. aegisz: Bruh a FLESHLIGHT is not a GF , I know you might think you can get away with that but you can't. Good try though kiddo ! Lawwwy: Nice man got em, you're right a fleshlight is not a gf. It also isn't nearly as good as the real thing, grow up and learn some respect before trying to be a dick.  aegisz: What respect ? Every virgin behind a keyboard pretending they have long term relationships and know what SEX IS ? gtfo you brown nose loser.. Lawwwy: Your logic clearly isn't there and you're showing just how idiotic you are to assume everyone behind a keyboard who supports lea is a virgin? How dumb do you have to be. Calm the fuck down virgin. aegisz: Yea only a fucking loser and a virgin would support that cheating wh0re it seems ppl are agreeing with me , she is a sad drunk and a leeching mong. You must really have no self-esteem to look up or even donate to a woman like her. Cuck Lawwwy: I've never donated to her and actually Im subbed with twitch prime so in no way am I spending money on her directly so like? Not to mention Lea doesnt leech and  just cause she drinks doesnt mean shes a drunk either? She doesnt depend on alcohol whatsoever. Nobodies agreeing with you either look at my upvotes compared to  yours hello? Stop getting so butthurt over who I choose to watch or support and trying to assume what type of guy I am by defending that person? GoserGozerian: Why does the sex he does or doesn't have, have to be part of the argument? No need to attack someone that you don't even know.

Skydogg5555: Yeah we all should revert to the stone ages and be naked wherever we are, good idea! Skydogg5555: If you think people who disagree with seeing nudity on a gaming platform meant for gaming purposes and nothing else, you must not know the definition of pornography.

I am not religious, I simply disagree with your viewpoint because it's obviously flawed and seems to stem from bigotry. The fact of the matter is, this discussion is pointless and your post is pointless. People have different opinions on nudity, and you aren't going to change it, no matter if it's right or wrong to \"cover\" yourself. My opinion is, there is a time and place for nudity, just like everything else. Skydogg5555: I don't really see how you would know what's right or moral, what exactly are you basing it on? I used a fairly valid example which is that most developed countries have in place laws against public nudity, can I not conclude that these laws are in place for a good reason?

They'll pull the plug on him so fast. There's a reason he's rarely brought on as a Twitch guest at events. He's popular because his fan base made him popular. I like chance. However he knows he has to build a better image of himself if he wants better partnerships with Twitch like DansGaming and others. That's why he dropped Mitch as a friend and will permanently no longer stream with him. Thats why he ran in on Lea and turned her stream off and called his girlfriend retarded. He's the only one in his little circle right now that's realizing that the community is shifting towards professional atmospheres and if he wants to stay in the game he's going to have to change his format.

There's no denying that people will be encouraged to send specific stuff depending on what's being joked about in the video and that Lily and Albert could actively take advantage of that. I just have a hard time calling it exploitation. It's ultimately harmless. No one is being forced or secretly manipulated to do something they aren't capable of deciding on their own. Those who send gifts \\*like\\* doing so. They get their money's worth. Exploitation would be if a streamer for example insinuated a deeper reward for buying gifts (like \"friendship\") and wouldn't actually provide this reward  but Liberty does NOTHING of the sort.' from subreddit: lilypichu\n",

Got too many shirts like that from other streamers and those go straight in the bin. \n",

      "Additionally, one thing I've noticed with press print shirts sometimes, is that it begins flaking off.

Thank you so much for your reply! Really wish there was a way to get silk screen printed shirts. &gt;.&lt; That might jack up the price, but... I'd take a really good comfy shirt if I  paid more.

With that being said I haven’t seen any weird conspiracists for lily/albert like I’ve seen for Janet/toast and don’t think ppl are as crazy about the shipping in this case and therefore think its fine for now. For the community though if you see the kinda creepy stuff that toast addressed try to notify the people involved/moderators to try and get rid of it :). nilez_13: In my opinion you're only clipping things Lily and Albert already feel like sharing.

IronHeinrich: The fact that you are even entertaining the idea that you could be perceived as a stalker for your actions I think shows a good natured tendency on your part. I'm also glad to read that you are willing to delete every clip you have should that be the case. I say just keep an eye out and if you catch any hint from Albert or Lily that your clipping is problematic for them, then you can take corrective actions.

I just have a hard time calling it exploitation. It's ultimately harmless. No one is being forced or secretly manipulated to do something they aren't capable of deciding on their own.
