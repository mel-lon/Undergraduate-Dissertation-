The claims were groundless, and my mother was hurt, not by my father, who has always done his utmost to be clear and faithful, but by the allegations levied against him. Had this been a couple working to get their relationship right, or had my father been less trustworthy or my mother been less trusting, this would have damaged their relationship permanently. He left, and only recently returned since his accusers left. People seem to forget the nature of tabloids, rumors, and lies.

Regardless of anyone’s opinion about ninja, his level of success in the gaming medium makes him a target to those who would take advantage of the juiciest story. To say people won’t sell the news in a way that disrespects his life choices and love for his wife, are ignorant of the way the news/media/world works. I, personally, don’t see sexism in Ninja’s actions, because the decision he’s making is not merely to preserve his career, but to preserve the honor of the woman he loves. I don’t know this for sure, but given the flak he’s gotten for this, that he KNOWS he would have gotten for this, I’m fairly certain he is willing to give up a majority of his successes if it means his relationship with his wife remains healthily intact. \n",

      "I'm also not sure who told Tom that bus lines shouldn't loop, but I'm guessing they're still giggling.  Bus lines absolutely should loop, they just shouldn't have too many stops.  Bus, metro and tram lines should also ideally have a 'reversed' line, a second line that mirrors the first but goes in the opposite direction.  The game allocates the appropriate amount of vehicles to a line automatically based on the usage, but Tom is using a mod that should make this work more efficiently and that he can override as necessary - so he doesn't absolutely need that reversed line, but it can still be a smart thing to add.  \n",

      "I prefer more editing.  It does not have to be North Side High levels of editing.  I know this will mean shorter or less frequent videos, but youtube is full of low effort lets plays.  What drew me to Tom is his editing.  I know minutes watched is the big deal on youtube now, but I think all these youtubers that throw a low effort \"completes\" series for easy minute viewed is not the answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stand out Tom. ptatoface: Tom, I don't know if you've been made aware of this since recording, but the tethers are a crucial part of the game that you're missing out on. To use them, all you have to do is put them in your inventory (not in the special slot that you put solar panels in) and press T to place them. Place the first one close enough to the base that you see a blue \"oxygen wire\" connected to it from the base. Then, you can connect a second tether to the first, a third to the second, and so on until you have a chain of them. If they're all connected, they should provide with oxygen (and energy if your base has it) in the same way that your base does. Basically, it means that you can explore for more than 20 seconds before having to run back to base for oxygen.\n",

      "On the question of editing, I think that it isn't really needed very much when playing multiplayer, and can be cut down a bit in singleplayer. For example, I personally wouldn't mind that much if you didn't do the thing where you show a picture of something whenever you say it, like trains in the recent Cities: Skylines episodes. mr_mallen: I'm probably echoing most peoples comments on youtube and reddit - prefer the highly editted because it sets tom apart but both styles are welcome. \n",
      "Another thing i'm really liking is that tom is working hard to make his viewers a part of his channel. I hope he keeps this going as his channel grows. The_WubWub: With this series since it is so multiplayer focus I do not mind less editing as the multiplayer is an effort in itself. More single player focused I love the editing that is currently on your channel. AngMod: I agree with you there. If he posted a larger ratio of multiplayer to solo content, and less editing got put into the multiplayer videos, it would help give Tom the time to edit those solo videos, whilst we still get content from him.' from subreddit: Angory_Tom\n",

I would also say that he should finish up the riverside industrial zone and then take a break for a while, and think specifically on how to finish up the rest of the riverside (for completions sake), and THEN in the last episodes of the series plan out and make Tech Island SUPER FANCY and packed with loads of details and special buildings (giant skyscrapers ofc).\n",

      "Then end the series I say, give it a clear end goal with lots of effort in the end and cut it before it drags on. If Tom can give this series a proper, well-defined, and memorable ending then it'll be one of the best series in Yogscast history. darthmorf: How about natural disasters to finish it off?

Charge bonuses can be very good on a mounted lord, but you need to cycle charge the lord for it to really be worth it.

Spawn are much more hitty than they are defendy, so generally you want to kill them before they can kill you as an approach. IIRC Morghur has a top row skill to give them missile resistance or a ward save though, which is an excellent pick because the main drawback of Spawn is how vulnerable they are to missile fire, especially from asshole Empire armies with a billion crossbowmans.

The \"that's my shit, fuckin your bitch\" part isn't so much a brag as it is the sad truth of the mindset I was in during high school; I got drunk and lost my virginity to a friend's girlfriend, who years later committed suicide. I also talk about how another friend got me into drinking, drugs and rapping, and how that friend also passed away.

I love all your content, including your videos, songs and even your fucking snapchats. The reason I am considering to stop supporting the patreon is because it seems like you don’t really have a direction for the channel. At least in past videos you’ve stated the channel doesn’t really have a direction and it’s more of a side project to your music career/video career/game developer career?/whatever it is you end up doing. This on top of things like seeing you go to pax, buying a new camera, and just recently visiting New York makes me wonder if my money is actually going towards content on the channel. We get a video a week if we’re lucky and I feel that right now your channel doesn’t seem like an investment I should make. To end this I want to say that I love you more than anything Jakey and I will be a hot boy to my grave.

The Silent Hill 2 video comes to mind, and parts of his Halo trilogy. Getting Your Heart Broken is one of the best examples. MyDickIsStuckInJam: I think the Dark Souls episode.

The reason I am considering to stop supporting the patreon is because it seems like you don’t really have a direction for the channel. At least in past videos you’ve stated the channel doesn’t really have a direction and it’s more of a side project to your music career/video career/game developer career?/whatever it is you end up doing.

Was hoping there was some sort of listing of past segments that I could use to at least see what to look for in the past broadcasts... Does she do these with any frequency? beastaa1: From what I remember there isn't any schedule for Dr poki ,they're not too far apart though,I think its every Friday I might be wrong but I recommend you tune in and check her live streams out,also her twitter can be very helpful too,hope I been a help to you (: DiamondDM13: Oh yeah, hopefully she announces it on Twitter, that would be good. Thank you. beastaa1: There's also ways you can talk to her and ask her yourself,like let her know your questions,concerns,wants wether via dono, tweet etc. She's really into that whole feedback from her community thing,I don't recommend you be annoying about it though DiamondDM13: Yeah I guess I can try that as well, drop her a message or something. Although it is not particularly feedback from the community. I'm not interested in League and such, and it seems her community does enjoy that, while what I find fun is something interesting and unique like the Dr. Poki segment. I assume her community backlash if she were to focus more on what I personally feel is more interesting.\n",

Thank you. beastaa1: Yeah she does have a awesome personality but she plays other games too like fortnite,me personally, I watch her a little bit more for who she is,but she's really good at games so I do learn from her,i believe all her content is fun and entertaining,anyways your welcome my friend,anytime,I'm glad I could help,peace out😅' from subreddit: Pokimane\n",

You would with a close friend you’re comfortable with though. Jason2469: You honestly think they looked over each other when they first met??? People who date call each other babe. You probs haven’t been in a relationship. It’s a common word used often. Either way. Fed saying babe is kind of a reach lol if someone wants to say that that means they’re dating  theblacksmithz: No I think they’re both into each other, and I think it’s likely they’ll be together in the end, but for now they’re just friends. I think you’re making the mistake of assuming ‘babes’ can only be used to refer to a significant other with, when really I refer to my platonic friends as babes sometimes, and cuz we’re just friends, they know it’s a joke. Btw, I have been in a relationship, and even if I hadn’t I, along with literally everyone ever, would know that couples call each other babes, but it’s not exclusive to this context. Jason2469: You said “textbook friend zone” when someone calls someone else “babe”. You were implying that someone doesn’t call their crush babe, or someone they’re “head over heels” for. And I’m saying. People who are in relationships and are used to each other, will call each other babe as if calling them by their actual name. Saying babe is hella casual in a relationship. More casual than with friends. That’s just a fact. Maybe it’s a cultural thing If you’re not in America, but in the US, that’s actually how it is' from subreddit: Pokimane\n",

      "i used to watch Poki when she streamed League of Legends,  accordingly her following base was lower than today´s. Which wasn´t bad, because she was way more of an personality than she is today, at least in my point of view. I understand that streaming could get less enjoyable with the time, especially when you kind of have to entertain and maintain the large viewership. Don´t get me wrong, iam not here to hate, she´s still a great streamer/player and helps so many people with really bad problems, but when iam watching her nowadays she seems kind of boring compared to the past. Today most of the time she is singing quietly and isnt really speaking to the chat while playing Fortnite. When she duos with a random or for example Cizzorz there isnt much conversation from her side and if it does it feels a little like a awkward smalltalk. I just posted this, because i want to know if iam the only one who feels like this. I still watch her from time to time, but it kind of feels a bit cringy compared to the old times. I want to point out, that this isn´t meant as hate, i just want to clarify if other people feel the same way as i do.  \n",

      "Thanks JohnLeffers: thanks for the interaction lads  human_nature_: Yeah I feel you here 100%, I sometimes wish she’d go back to streaming league but hey whatever  LimonadeSenpai: I agree with you. I almost never watch her stream since she started playing fotnite BagelsAndJewce: This isn't super surprising. Her audience has drastically changed in the past few months and so has the game. League is one of almost pure isolation unless you duo with someone. You just grind away while fortnite is almost the complete opposite. It reduces down time and encourages playing with other people. Combine that with the fact that her audience is bigger and of course shes not going to interact with chat more or the same as before. It's just a different dynamic. She still does sit around and talk to stream at the beginning and end of streams so it's still there just that the main course is different.  theblacksmithz: You talk about her being pretty quiet, but it’s obviously really difficult to be constantly talking for 3 hours per stream, 3 or 4 days per week for however many years she’s been going. The reality is talking for extended periods of time is really unnatural, and most people struggle to do it for even one minute. So I think it’s justified for her to be quiet/singing song lyrics or whatever in silences, and I think if she talked constantly it’d be the most annoying shit ever XD. If you watch one of Ninja’s, he’s quiet most of the time, much more than Poki, but that’s probz cuz he streams everyday for so long.' from subreddit: Pokimane\n",

Are there more conventions being reached out to? Are people and #fam reaching out? Should that be something brought through the discord page? Also is there plans for a schedule of the upcoming conventions that are being planned every month that was possibly suggested? I think that if the discord page had a schedule thread, a convention thread, and maybe like a Twitch stream suggestion/poll thread some ideas could be easier to glean from the subs and patron fan base with some easier organization.

GTAman51: Can you help me understand why are you here if you're not a fan?  tenkini: Can you help me understand how to type? :( Blindobb: Because I find it fascinating that someone like this hasn't been banned considering her blatant sexualisation as a core part of her content, revealing clothing, and low effort streams, and still seems to have a really dedicated fanbase regardless of whether she has any talent or not and is based on looks alone.  I think it's a really good question you have though and I don't have a real answer for you.

It's not like I lurk in her chat 24/7 but any time I find myself there, so are you. npw39487w3pregih: i kinda get the hate too, but \"low effort\" is ridiculous, clearly nobody is working harder moosetiger: it’s cuz she’s hot vegandawg: Talent? You serious? Who has talent on twitch? It's a bunch of personalities.... Find it strange people watch DrDisrespect but can understand why people like Amouranth.  Blindobb: I mean Twitch is primarily a place for video game streaming and he’s actually good at video games. That along with his incredibly high effort streams with professional graphic design and an incredibly deep streamlab overlay, he has an original character that he created and doesn’t just spout dead memes and dance for subs or donations, which is pathetic and really close to being a modest stripper by the way, is probably why he pulls in 10 times the amount of viewers amouranth has. If you are going to try to compare streams he isn’t a good one to pick. Say what you want about his personal life or who he is as a person but the quality and effort put into his stream is indisputable. People may not like him but my girlfriend doesn’t like Breaking Bad but that doesn’t mean it’s a bad show. It means she is a tasteless bitch.  vegandawg: Well we'll have to agree to disagree there. I personally find an attractive girl with a super hero body to be more \"art\" than some douchebag trying to ironically look like a 80's metal personality and playing boring video games. She does more than dance around and recently does stuff with an asmr mic. There's no accounting for taste afterall though. Personally I love breaking bad as well and my wife hates it too. Don't watch amouranth much (probably watch world of tanks streamers more than her) but hard to dismiss her as a \"modest stripper\". Do you think the same of say STPeach? Is something wrong with a gal dressing in such a way that appeals to her target audience? Isn't that what DrDisrespect does with his getup?' from subreddit: Amouranth\n",

So is it only bad if it involves good-looking women? What if a famous streamer like say - Day9 talked about non-gaming content. Would that upset you aswell? \n",

      "Second there is non gameplay content that is csgo gambling on websites which is not part of the game and not gameplay.

This is the shit that should be banned and regarding for lea her non gaming content usually involves an \"accident\" of her showing her ass so yea that's why hers is a problem. If she wanted to have non gameplay content and conduct herself in an appropriate manner then it'd be okay. But she is a drunken slob when this happens and to be perfectly honest its trashy as fuck to watch her drunk slurring her words.

NevyTheChemist: Her beef curtains. Riposte_This: It's not a criminal offense, it is civil.  PESH28: I cannot work out how Twitch bans. Some notably toxic cancerous streamers, including one who goes into the streamers of female streamers to talk thrash, are completely ban free.  I hope Lea at least buys a pair of knicker for when she next streams. Sloop_Pilot: But in his last youtube video he said that it was a lie? So therefore it is slander. I think I agree with the point you are making in that they shouldn't have banned him because it was not actually proven he was defaming, but in the end it was true he was defaming. Sloop_Pilot: I agree that it was quite a, for lack of better words, 'dick move' to do that. Unless I haven't seen something, there is nothing to say that it was actually krepo who contacted twitch to get him banned. If there is something, please share with me :D. \n",
      "Whilst I do feel really sorry for GG, Krepo didn't deserve any of that either. Accusing someone of a criminal offence when they didn't commit it is a crime, and so GG was punished for it. Pretty sure he was on final warnings too. I think perma ban was too harsh though. It's like getting a life sentence he should get another chance really. But Tuck Fwitch.

Vorlax: someone explain to me why yall hate her? never watched her streams so the hate seems unwarranted from here ExCinisCineris: Her saying all kids with cancer are meant to die, her getting away with multiple ToS infractions that most other people would be banned for and, for her being an insufferable cunt on twitter. Also this is just in the last two months there is a lot more of you keep looking. Vorlax: OH SHIT THIS IS THE BITCH THAT SAID THE CANCER THING?

Good job reddit! crystalblooo: The guy got on his knees on a chat with the twitch admins and begged them to keep his channel up and give him a chance. If they even knew Ali they'd know he's genuine and would change immediately, twitch was legitimately his life and he loved it.

However, I doubt this is the state of mind Suzy is in when complaining about it.  Backerel: The problem I have with Momo is the way she acts and talks. It's almost like a little girl. I found it extremely disturbing. I thought maybe it's just me but when I asked my girlfriend she had the same opinion.\n",
      "The game is really fun and surprisingly adictive. And all the other characters are so over the top and stereotypical that at moments it makes me think is a parody. So I think they are so irrealistic that they end up being more funny than ofensive. That said, Momo is too much for me. SeeYouSpaceCorgi:  I think in saying what you said you proved two other things. It either further proves my point, and it also proves shows how fetishes have an impact on your preference of girl priority in this game. You're right, her childishness nature may come across as weird to a few people, but that's just another fetish, it's Ageplay or Babygirl. Either way, if you don't like it and find it off-putting, it's just something that the game doesn't cater for you 100% and like the rest of the game, the same way I don't find the porn actress or the stewardess thing attractive/offputting.

However, the Korean language in terms of reading and writing is built to be simple and easy to learn.

It's not that I was a loner or anything, I did have friends, I was just a very average kid. Everything about me screams average.

While I can't say my life was exactly the same (my chinese parents were surprisingly not very stereotypical), I can say that I experienced some of it. That includes playing piano, self-esteem issues, trouble making friends, pressure of expectations to the point you just kind of just give up, and turning to games and anime to feel better. I also kept my head up by learning to play anime music on the piano.\n",

All this time I thought \"How come I feel so bad on the inside when I shouldn't be? Why aren't other people having these problems? What is wrong with me?\" I hated myself for that. After watching her video, I realized, \"Wow, someone who I really enjoy watching, someone who has many many fans, can still experience the same struggles that I did.\" I know this concept may seem obvious, but to someone like me who had a constant battle with his own mind, it was hard to see things outside my own view. \n",

      "Rather than ignore the hate (I'm not saying it's easy, stuff gets to everyone sometimes), many people, such as this person, try to hop right on that hate train and blame the \"real problem\". Problem is, hopping on the hate train won't stop your haters. It will only attract more people who enjoy hopping on that hate train.
