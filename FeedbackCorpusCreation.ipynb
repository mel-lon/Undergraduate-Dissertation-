Yes, drake makes more, Kendrick makes more, 50 makes more, but think of all of the people that don’t make nearly that. Any average sports player, any pop/rap/country artist who isn’t A-list. They had to work their whole lives for that shit, he didn’t. That’s the difference.

Truck simulator? More astroneer (is tough as sjin is so busy)  something survivaly like rust or ark? a long thing like modded skyrim/fallout? who knows!? meteshjj: I would absolutely love to see you play Resident Evil VII... But, if you're not into horror games, I can understand that. Something along the lines of Prison Architect/Factorio/Rim World would be pretty entertaining, too. GWhizKatlifa: Firstly play what ever makes you happy, I never want to force a YouTuber to play something they won't enjoy or are bored of. Makes for crummy videos and the bwo bwo bwo boom buwoooo trumpet noise all the times. \n",
      "\n",
      "I personally loved your cities skylines and planet coaster videos, and would love a return to the racy world of theme park creation. I think your editing and commentary works really well with that genre of game, but it's also something that I love to watch people play :)  StupidSexyPhilanders: I would say Prison Architect, Rimworld or modded Skyrim/Fallout. Rad_Carrot: I'd probably recommend Prison Architect, or maybe another building/management game. Planet Coaster and Stardew Valley are both great games but perhaps a little overplayed on YouTube of late.\n",
      "\n",
      "Definitely Warhammer of course. I would also enjoy a Rimworld series, and if you like it then all the more reason to play it. I'd probably recommend you play it on a casual setting though.\n",

      "If you don't like horror games I wouldn't play them on the channel, it rarely makes for good viewing watching people pick their way through a horror level slowly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two other games would be either Aven Colony, which is Tropico in space, which would compliment your chilled pace, or alternatively why not give X-Com a go? Any iteration would be fun, but I'd say Enemy Unknown would be best. _Helene_: Obviously more of what you yourself enjoying doing, which has already been said here. \n",
      "Definitely would not mind some Rim world! \n",
      "\n",
      "A podcast style thing also sounds awesome :)\n",

It's only because we got some twisted satisfaction in observing others get scared!(and we probably would not dare to play them ourselves...) UnreadyTripod: tekkit with sjin iOStanley: Any chance you could make an appearance on the Triforce? Afreeusernameihope: Please finish Cities Skylines properly first! \n",
      "After that do whatever you find fun!  Darth-Gabrich: HOI 4 could be really cool, especially if you have the commonwealth expansion: you could play as like a fascist/communist India or smth! Brettholomeul: Oooh, seconding Prison Architect. I'd love to see the Angor spin on that. WhitePawn00: Stellaris maybe? Especially with Ben! That would be awesome to watch. darthmorf: I've pinned this so people will see it! \n",
      "\n",
      "Rimworld sounds really good and it would be awesome of you popped into discord occasionally - we have great fun chatting about random things!  ThexJakester: Rim world would make my freaking day. every day an episode came out. forever. SpacecraftX: An RPG. Skyrim or Fallout perhaps. Or any other RPG. They're good for the characters you come up with.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prison Architect too. It's ripe for the same character stuff you do in Cities Skylines too. I imagine it would have as similar flow too. Bertdog211: Modded CK2 would be great  darthmorf: Good ol' sipsy FuriousGorilla: 1000x Rimworld! ThexJakester: Something like Divinity Original Sin (1/2) would be pretty neat. Its a very freedom oriented role playing game, lots of customization &amp; a very good story. juggled_geese: I was thinking the other day that I'd love to see you do a horror game but if that's not something you enjoy playing then you should probably skip it. (just ask sips how his re7 streams went) \n",
      "\n",
      "A long series like fallout/skyrim would be fun and We happy few would be awesome! I don't think it's been covered much by yogs.  Flufs: should not have mentioned the fact that you hate horror games, since now a lot of people most definitely want to see you give some horror a go. \n",
      "\n",
      "rimworld is a good shout. pillars of eternity maybe, if that style appeals to you? darkest dungeon? skyrim/fallout-type rpg is not a bad idea either. Grandpa_Edd: Play whatever you like man.

      "\n",
      "Factorio would be awesome too but I think that's a one you'd need to team up with someone for. It's a little bit dull in single player but a bunch of fun as a co-op.  Patteroast: I think a podcasty thing sounds amazing, maybe with random guests to chat about random things with. Maybe even... the Tap Twins?\n",
      "\n",
      "Otherwise, your Cities: Skylines stuff has been my favorite so far, and I think Rust would be pretty good too. But really, whatever you like to do. I'll be honest and say I might skip a series if it's a game I can't stand, but I think it's more important to have fun, and there are plenty of people with different tastes in games from me. Burtonm: Factorio sounds amazing, after Lewis and Duncan stop playing I've been jonesing for some more Anticlere: I'm gonna echo everyone and their mum and say Rimworld would be amazing. The game is phenomenal on its own, and it feels like it'd work great with the same kind of editing style as the Cities Skylines videos\n",
      "\n",
      "A stab at (modded?) Morrowind would be phenomenal IMO, but I realize there's lots of reasons why that might not be the best idea so instead I'll cast a vote firmly in favour of a long thing like Skyrim/Fallout - or just some kinda long open-ended-ish RPG, whichever of those you'd enjoy most really Keckers: Theme hospital?   Big pharma?  Prison architect?   \n",

      "I loved the extra long episode here.  For anyone wondering, the movement of raw materials basically works like this; \n",
      "\n",
      "- They are *extracted* as raw from the ground\n",
      "- They are *refined* \n",
      "- They are *exported* to a supplier.  \n",
      "\n",
      "This works the same with all four raw materials present in the game; farming products, lumber, ore and oil.\n",
      "\n",
      "An industry present on any raw material will probably start either 'extracting' it (e.g. building a farm, creating a lumber yard) or refining it, or you can force *all industry present in the district* to focus on it, like Tom did to Slag Works.  If he'd have kept the other part of the district focused on ore too (the part that did not have the ore, that became Slag heap) they would have built only ore refining buildings rather than ore extracting buildings.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Once the raw materials are out of the ground, they are sent to the refining buildings, or exported out of the map if none are present.  Once the materials have been refined, they are exported - this can be either;\n",
      "\n",
      "- To another industry (this may have changed)\n",
      "- To a commercial building elsewhere in the city\n",
      "- Out of the map\n",
      "\n",
      "You can follow the supply and demands of the industries and commercial sectors by using some of the overlays.  If a refinery industry is built without having the raw materials present, it will import them from off the map; likewise, a commercial building needing raw materials will import them if none are being produced in your city. Generally, it's better to have the commercial sectors relying off your own industry (essentially it cuts down on highway traffic and allows both buyer and seller to cut costs, which means they pay more to you and grow more), but it can be difficult to balance.  Plus, it can increase traffic between districts if it's not managed well.  Tom should also be aware that unless he's got certain mods installed, the ore will run out over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, denying cims of education doesn't work well in this game; cims will travel as far as they need to to get to school - any school! - which can increase traffic.  It's best to simply have a variety of industries and level them up as quick as possible.  New adult arrivals to the city generally will arrive as uneducated (this can change with certain mods), so as long as you're building houses slowly and steadily you should have a workforce. connorockz: Amazing!

      "\n",
      "Characters are written in such a way that the tropes they seem like at the beginning are never the full story; the game tackles really mature topics while not becoming a gritty gritfest that takes itself too seriously; the way the more narritively driven life as an animu schoolboi is interwoven with the more systems driven turn based combat is genius - it actually baffles me that other games are so seperated in that regard, because youre used to stopping one to do the other and vice versa; the music is phantastic; the UI is super styleish and has so much character; the world is packed with quality interactions and changes throughout the game, so visiting spots you haven't been to in a while is worth it; and also just the sheer concept of the game is utterly unique.\n",

But then I played it over the summer, right after I played Persona 4 Golden (which I loved as well), and god damn that game is impressive. The presentation of Persona 5 is beyond words, the UI is flashy, the soundtrack (like P3 &amp; P4) is a gem, the combat (unlike P3 &amp; P4) is actually fun, the characters are unique and bring thier own weight to the narrative, I could go on, but we would be here for hours.

      "Jakey I recently came across your vids and fell in love with them. The previous few years have not been kind to me, but I didn't expect them to. For a long time in my life, my home was a stress-inducing powder keg that provided ample fear of social behaviors on my part. I've got brothers who are on the spectrum and others who've made mistakes in their lives that have changed their outcomes greatly. I'm the youngest of all of them and was used to being picked on but they were ruthless and didn't care much for my thoughts. I didn't exactly come out clean. I became a bully at school and did things that in retrospect I wish I hadn't ever done. It led me to now, at 18 where I've finished school and have been trying to atone for the sins of my past. I recently went to a doctor after I started thinking about killing myself. I couldn't find happiness in much for a time. \n",

People like you trying to do what they love against all odds has given me the strength to finally push past my depression to a road where I can truly better myself. The last three years I've been in high school and college and have earned a variety of credits that I originally wanted to apply to computer engineering, but when I saw the passion someone like you can put into their creations, especially your audio producing, I wanted to explore that option.\n",

It's a constant territory war where the aliens have to spread their infection across the entire facility, and the humans have to try and wipe it out entirely. As their infection spreads, it will knock out power and such, meaning that human areas are nicely lit with functioning facilities (because that's what humans need), whereas alien areas are dark and covered in gross slimey growths that make human traversal harder. In either area the enemy team feels out of their comfort zone.\n",

      "Dead Space is a third person action horror game series not unalike Resident Evil 4 and 5, also set in futurey sci-fi places. Weird alien artifacts turn humans into gross monsters called necromorphs, that further spread by killing and turning humans. It's a tense game that keeps you on your toes at all moments (except maybe the third one). It features a diverse and iconic enemy (the necromorphs) that could easily serve in place of the Kharaa (alien bad dudes in Natural Selection), and creative weapons that differentiate themselves from standard shooters with their unique purposes and designs. The weapons aren't simply meant to kill, they're meant to dismember the necromorphs, so it requires knowledge of all necromorph's weakpoints to chop them into little bits with as few shots as possible.\n",

      "Think about it, the gameplay of Natural Selection 2 but with a team of undead gamer girls vs plasma cutter wielding hot boys. There's already a Dead Space multiplayer gamemode that allows people to play as necromorphs, so it's already been proven there's enough variety in necromorph morphology (necromorphology?) to constitute different classes. A battle for a ship like the Ishimura between the forces of the Marker and Earthgov (even though they kinda built the second marker? whatever). The human team uses all the repurposed tools Isaac has access to in the single player (also using power nodes as a form of currency to upgrade said tools) and the different RIG suits (Security, Engineer, Triage, etc.) can constitute the different classes. The necromorph team has all the different evolutions of necromorphs to play as. Slashers are standard brutes who can use vents and their incredible speed to close the gap with human players. Infectors are weak and require stealth but can turn human corpses into one time use spawn points for slasher players. Pukers are standard range that can spec their puke into multiple effects such as their default slow effect. Cysts and Guardians act as land mines and sentry turrets for the necromorph team respectively. The Pack are a weak melee class but could receive additional movement based abilities or buffs to their stats when playing close to other Pack players (like an actual Pack would). Brutes would be a standard tank class, encouraging human players to aim for the weakpoints as they would in the singleplayer game. The Ubermorph could even act as a miniboss class like the Tank from L4D2's versus mode or the Onos from Natural Selection. Just as in the singleplayer, power nodes could also instead be used to open locked off areas, or power facilities such as automated defenses, making a player really think about how they should use these precious nodes. I know that this already far fetched idea is made even more distant by the disbanding of Visceral Games, but...\n",

      "\n",
      "The gameplay of U.S. Most Wanted can be described as a first-person shooter with tactical and simulation elements, these being reflected by the game's emphasis on custom mission load outs and high lethality of firearms.\n",
      "\n",
      "The arsenal also includes tripwire claymores, silenced variants of several guns, various rocket and grenade launchers, as well as non-combat items like binoculars and almost entirely unimplemented lockpicks. In combat, any damage to the player can easily prove fatal, with light and heavy armor subsiding some damage, but reducing carrying capacity and not protecting against shots to the head.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, U.S. Most Wanted is notable for its inconsistent and problematic gameplay, with extremely fast deaths, a lack of audible enemy movement, vague mission parameters, and AI that ranges between erratic and a constant \"charge and shoot\" pattern. These coincide with major, often unavoidable, irregularities left unfixed in the game and various other design or technical anomalies to be found.\n",

By the end, physical, mental, and moral disruption leave each character in a very different place than they started.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every firefight ends with Walker and his Delta Force squad regretting what they've done. The Line puts them in the precarious position of fighting their brethren.

You have a full-scale riot now downtown, thousands of addicts that breaking into pharmacies to take their drugs.

Steezus_H_Christ: This was the first time I actually couldn't get through one of his videos. I'm a big fan of his stuff, but I personally really hated what he did with the green screen.

This will give you a general idea of your enemy. \n",

More paid promotions and in general acting over the top so the clips are good for the YouTube video. Which is what I'm guessing they meant by scripted too.  Not necessarily line for line scripted, but it just seems a little obvious she does certain things on purpose because it would make a better video title or clip.

Kobdzio: The issue is deeply rooted in today's society. I encourage you to watch the video that I mentioned in my initial comment. Thanks! TeepEU: I did, all Jack says is that the friend-zone should be an indication to move on from the person who friend-zoned you. Which is the same way that Poki uses it? Kobdzio: Yes, but he air quotes the phrase \"friendzone\" because it's ridiculous. It rejects the idea of a friendship with an opposite gender. I don't see it as a funny thing to say :/ for me it just shows how men are portrayed by society. Maybe it's just my problem but a lot of people don't even understand the problem with \"friendzone\" xd and I've seen plenty of discussions on the internet. You can dive into the topic yourself. TeepEU: friendzone doesn't deny the idea of a friendship with the opposite gender, it's specifically for when one of two parties would want to date, whereas the other just wants to be friends. Kobdzio: I dont think I'm qualified enough to convince you that the problem with the friendzone is more than just a silly relationship with a  girl that doesn't feel the same way xd as I said before there are a lot of discussions on the internet on the topic.

      "\n",
      "It sounds like you're expecting her to roll over and just accept the service that she's given. Or anyone for that matter. She's a paying customer! And this is an expensive up-scale salon.  Why would she (or anyone) pay for something that she didnt ask for and/or continually messed up? If it was merchandise she could just return it, but dying hair is more long term. And there's only so many things they can do to fix it before her hair falls apart. The salon got to that point failing every attempt to fix their mistake; even after being shown a picture of what she wanted. They can call the cops or security or ban her for a year, but I wouldn't expect anyone to sit there and be like, \"this is fine,\" when its so clearly not. \n",

I do personally think the analogy isn't all that far off but that is of course open to interpretation.\n",
      "As for my lack of backbone perhaps it could use a bit of strengthening, so let me have it reddit. Hopefully I can take it ;) AoM336: Well that was a little terse of me. No way in hell I woulda paid for that dye job though. Like, if I had to sit with there with my wife for 10 hours while they fk'd her hair up, I know I'd be madder than hell. $200 AND my whole day? No way.  insignificantdaikini: I've never gotten off to her. I do however find her attractive and like her geeky personality but she is for certain over self inflated, self entitled and high on her horse. This episode I thought was a perfect demonstration of that and it truly did piss me off.  tenkini: while you are certainly entitled to your opinion I disagree with your restaurant metaphor.  What happened is she went into the salon and asked to get her hair done a specific way, showed pictures for a reference and sat down to let them provide the service  she had requested, they then proceeded to do something completely different,  they didn't give her the color she asked for originally because the stylist thought that the way she wanted to do it would look better, they didn't go the gradual blend from brown to blonde that she asked for and instead did a straight line, and they spent 1 hours continuing to not do what she had originally asked them to, so it's less like ordering something and then not liking it, as going to a restaurant and ordering a steak, and 70 minutes later they bring you soup, and then you remind them that's not what you asked for, so they send it back to the kitchen and another 70 minutes later they bring you pork, 99% of restaurants would comp your meal in this situation not call security and ban you from the premises.  That's my personal opinion on the situation, could she have handled it differently? sure. Was there potentially a \"better way\"? maybe. I also would mention that it's probably reasonable to be a little unhappy/snippy/critical with someone after they spend 10 hours of your time not doing the job you hired them for (that would normally take 3-6 hours if done properly the first time).  Feel free to call me a \"White Knight Cuck\" or whatever won't hurt my feelings any, that's just my view on the situation if you are interested in a second opinion/perspective slipperygash: And a pissed of wife to boot  Blakencakes: I missed that day. Wow lol  5n0rl4xm4573rr4c3: I mean let's not kid anyone the situation was sadly handled extremly poor on both sides and should not have been streamed period. Mr__Sweet: God the people defending this kind of behavior are ridiculous.

Like she did something to her face. AlignedManatee: Even the mod knows what's up Hi_Im_Armand: It's the fact that other streamers get banned for much less, like watching a youtube video on stream. While she has flashed her ass countless times. People are angry at twitch and their favoritism towards Lea.  just4thrillz: Major violations? He called Kaceytron a hoe on twitter which is not even related to twitch and got a warning for that.... Hi_Im_Armand: I never said perma banned, but banned for less reasons than intentionally flashing private parts. Especially ever since twitch tried to be fair and stop male streamers from being able to stream without a shirt on to avoid sexual content, the amount of warnings Lea specifically has gotten is absurd.  Riposte_This: They need to just ban drinking on Twitch, especially if you're partnered. It's your fucking job, treat it like one. Lea clearly can't handle her alcohol, and fucks up constantly. I actually feel bad for Sodapoppin.  Doubletift-Zeebbee: That's what alcoholism does to you. fasteddeh: The problem is they banned being belligerently drunk on stream already, she just also skates by that rule as if it doesn't exist as well as the no dancing on stream, non gaming/overly sexual content/nudity. name it she doesn't apply to that rule like the rest of twitch does. It's really sad because things like this just leave a black eye on site as a whole as well as most likely gives all the pervert trolls more confidence to be dicks to other women when they stream Hi_Im_Armand: Idiots will always take it too far, but the reason initially was what I stated. Soda is a popular guy, and when Lea cheated on him people turned on her. That could be another reason.  360gunner: Shut the fuck up you disgusting SJW. Get off your high horse. Everything must trigger you people. Why don't you get everyone of your cult members and ho live in a fucking cave.

      "Are really just blowing if off from Lea because she is slutty? You brain dead idiots are unreal. She has done this multiple times and if she doesn't get punished it proves Twitch is a complete joke and cares more about money then it's actually reputation.  Riposte_This: Oh I didn't know that man, so many streams get away with it. It's also against Twitch rules to drink for money and some streams literally base entire days on breaking that rule. Yet Twitch does nothing. I'm not saying what Gross Gore said was ok by any means, but I feel like his ban being permanent is a little ridiculous considering Lea and many others just give no fucks  for the rules.  noped2012: I don't care what Krepo said about him. He didn't get on stream and say it. That's the point. All I'm saying is that what he did was way more serious and harmful than what Lea did in my opinion. And you can call me a brain dead idiot all you want haha, it's just my opinion and I stand by it. You sound like you're just mad at the world and somehow whether or not Lea is banned directly affects your livelihood. I honestly just don't give a fuck.... I'd never watch her anyway. Doesn't affect me. I could care less if Twitch has perfect morals, it's a company. There are a ton of companies that do way more fucked up and unethical shit that I'd be worried about before worrying about this but that's just me. fasteddeh: Of course it's ridiculous. The people who get in good with admins will get by breaking any of the rules while those who don't make friends up high are on a obey or be hung as an example standard that way the extreme punishment will let the others be able to do crazy shit and others won't try as much to emulate them putraadibadham: jesus christ Stretch127: People reaaaally dont like this chick.

      "Im puzzled - I don't understand why people dislike the non-gaming content on twitch. Also - basically every channel has content which is not related to gameplay at all. So is it only bad if it involves good-looking women? What if a famous streamer like say - Day9 talked about non-gaming content. Would that upset you aswell? \n",
      "\n",
      "For the record, he does that - quite a lot, 50% of his stream is about pussies. mhselif: First of all the \"non gameplay content\" is to much of an open statement many types of non gameplay content exist.\n",
      "\n",
      "First you have non gameplay content streams where they watch youtube videos, look at reddit or just browse things on the internet. This should be moved to gaming talk shows after 30 minutes based on what I hear is twitch policy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second there is non gameplay content that is csgo gambling on websites which is not part of the game and not gameplay. This is kind of a grey area right now, but I've heard rumors that twitch is coming down with some new rules regarding gambling on these websites possibly having to move to a different section\n",

      "Thirdly this is the non gameplay content that people have a problem with, the non gameplay content where someone is sitting in full screen acting like a fucking tool majority of girls that do this clearly using this time to exploit there body for some gain or publicity. This is the shit that should be banned and regarding for lea her non gaming content usually involves an \"accident\" of her showing her ass so yea that's why hers is a problem. If she wanted to have non gameplay content and conduct herself in an appropriate manner then it'd be okay. But she is a drunken slob when this happens and to be perfectly honest its trashy as fuck to watch her drunk slurring her words. Shes a fucking grown ass women not a teenage party girl she needs to grow the fuck up.\n",

      "\n",
      "For me personally if people like soda,summit,tim spend an hour of there stream non gaming content by all means go ahead. Ever notice how the majority of girls the second the game ends or they go do something they instantly go fullscreen for as long as possible till the next game? If a guy did it id have the same problem but majority of the time guys dont sit full cam for that long and if they do they are not bending over showing there ass or making sure there cleavage is in the camera frame.\n",

Doubletift-Zeebbee: That's what alcoholism does to you. fasteddeh: The problem is they banned being belligerently drunk on stream already, she just also skates by that rule as if it doesn't exist as well as the no dancing on stream, non gaming/overly sexual content/nudity. name it she doesn't apply to that rule like the rest of twitch does. It's really sad because things like this just leave a black eye on site as a whole as well as most likely gives all the pervert trolls more confidence to be dicks to other women when they stream Hi_Im_Armand: Idiots will always take it too far, but the reason initially was what I stated. Soda is a popular guy, and when Lea cheated on him people turned on her. That could be another reason.  360gunner: Shut the fuck up you disgusting SJW. Get off your high horse. Everything must trigger you people. Why don't you get everyone of your cult members and ho live in a fucking cave. Then you all won't have to worry about everything triggering you! decaboniized: You do realize Krepo was making accusations that he raped someone correct?\n",

      "Are really just blowing if off from Lea because she is slutty? You brain dead idiots are unreal. She has done this multiple times and if she doesn't get punished it proves Twitch is a complete joke and cares more about money then it's actually reputation.  Riposte_This: Oh I didn't know that man, so many streams get away with it. It's also against Twitch rules to drink for money and some streams literally base entire days on breaking that rule. Yet Twitch does nothing. I'm not saying what Gross Gore said was ok by any means, but I feel like his ban being permanent is a little ridiculous considering Lea and many others just give no fucks  for the rules.  noped2012: I don't care what Krepo said about him. He didn't get on stream and say it. That's the point. All I'm saying is that what he did was way more serious and harmful than what Lea did in my opinion. And you can call me a brain dead idiot all you want haha, it's just my opinion and I stand by it. You sound like you're just mad at the world and somehow whether or not Lea is banned directly affects your livelihood. I honestly just don't give a fuck.... I'd never watch her anyway. Doesn't affect me. I could care less if Twitch has perfect morals, it's a company. There are a ton of companies that do way more fucked up and unethical shit that I'd be worried about before worrying about this but that's just me. fasteddeh: Of course it's ridiculous. The people who get in good with admins will get by breaking any of the rules while those who don't make friends up high are on a obey or be hung as an example standard that way the extreme punishment will let the others be able to do crazy shit and others won't try as much to emulate them putraadibadham: jesus christ Stretch127: People reaaaally dont like this chick.

She's a *submissive catgirl*  because that's just a common trope for catgirls on the internet. It just makes sense, it's an efficient way of giving people playing the game what they might want.\n",

      "This might be an unpopular opinion but I'm just defending the point of the game here and saying what I felt should be said. Downvotes are welcome, but discussion is moreso. eulerhopepunk: I think it's amusing because Suzy gets labeled an SJW a lot by her detractors, but if you've ever seen the Huniepop Twitter... WoodPlanking: Hunniepop twitter? \n",

      "https://twitter.com/HuniePop\n",
      "\n",
      "Huh. Mr. Pop sure has some words to say and he sure is saying them. WoodPlanking: Ye. I agree. This game is obviously just \"hey play the puzzle part so you can see their boobs and hear them moan\". So its a little Silly to complain about that. However, I doubt this is the state of mind Suzy is in when complaining about it.  Backerel: The problem I have with Momo is the way she acts and talks. It's almost like a little girl. I found it extremely disturbing. I thought maybe it's just me but when I asked my girlfriend she had the same opinion.\n",
      "The game is really fun and surprisingly adictive. And all the other characters are so over the top and stereotypical that at moments it makes me think is a parody. So I think they are so irrealistic that they end up being more funny than ofensive. That said, Momo is too much for me. SeeYouSpaceCorgi:  I think in saying what you said you proved two other things. It either further proves my point, and it also proves shows how fetishes have an impact on your preference of girl priority in this game. You're right, her childishness nature may come across as weird to a few people, but that's just another fetish, it's Ageplay or Babygirl. Either way, if you don't like it and find it off-putting, it's just something that the game doesn't cater for you 100% and like the rest of the game, the same way I don't find the porn actress or the stewardess thing attractive/offputting. But I'm not gonna suddenly start to say the game's gone too far because it's just too good at what it was saying it was in the first place.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sure though, I will agree that sub/dom play is a little more intense than the other fetishes, but the dev helped people out this way by making us work for Momo. She's a *hidden* character so people don't have to have that fetish rubbed in people's faces. You actually have to go out of your way to find her in the first place. chuma93: to be fair, arin said all that and she agreed, i think suzy does want to make her channel in a politically correct ground for some reason. which i found quite naive \n",

      "\n",
      "Here is my personal opinion of what you should definitely go for and eat while you're here!\n",
      "\n",
      "**Things to eat**:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Durians are a must-try. Most people say it's smelly and all, but its usually a hit or miss. Some people love it while some people hate it. It's like a 50-50 percent thing, but it really grows on you if you love it. There's even a place built and designed to look like the durian in Singapore! (Esplanade\\*)\n",
      "2. Hainanese Chicken Rice. This is also another must try, although I can't seem to find any really good ones cause they're all pretty similar IMO. I do feel that personally, the best Chicken Rice come from the hawker centres. (they are food centres housing many stalls that sell a variety of inexpensive food.)\n",
      "3. Chilli Crab.  Basically, chilli crab is a seafood dish in which stir-fried crab is coated with sweet and spicy tomato based sauce. If you are looking for typical and enjoyable dishes in Singapore, you definitely cannot miss out on this.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Places to go:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Gardens by the bay. Flowers, plants, and many other nature related items are located at this gigantic nature park. \n",
      "2. Universal Studios Singapore. Basically the Disney of Singapore. And since Universal Studios Singapore is within Sentosa, you can explore Sentosa while you're at it too! They have many small individual locations within the place, such as beaches and food centres, and is a great place for leisure activities :D.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have so much more I want to share as a Singaporean but nothing really comes to my head at the moment:(. Will edit this post if I remember anything. Do feel free to drop your links and recommendations in the comments guys and hopefully this will serve to be helpful to lily and the rest while they're in Singapore for their Hyperplay event!\n",
      "\n",
      "P.S. Hope Lily and the rest of OfflineTV have a great time in Singapore :D. GetNovaKoiedM8: OMFG CHILI CRAB IS BOMB. I've only been to Singapore like once when I was in elementary but holy butthole I remember the crab so vividly well 😁 HebiIsSnake: I agree! Really grateful to have it so accessibly and conveniently located near me too :)  recruz95: Other food that you can try:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Laksa. Rice noodles in fragrant coconut milk + curry soup. Some versions, like Katong Laksa, have the noodles cut shorter so you can eat it with just a spoon.\n",
      "2. Fried Carrot Cake. Unlike the name, it's actually made of radish, not carrots. There's two versions, black and white. Black is sweet while white is more savory.\n",
      "3. Kway Chap. Large flat rice noodles in soup/gravy with braised pig intestines, pig skin, fish cake etc. Might be an acquired taste tho (especially if you're not one for innards)\n",
      "4. Bak Kut Teh. Literally translates to \"Meat bone tea\". Pork ribs cooked in a peppery soup base, usually eaten with rice. \n",
      "5. Kaya Toast. Toast with sweet kaya jam (made from coconut, eggs etc.). Recommend going to one of the many \"Ya Kun Kaya Toast\" branches, can be found in many parts of Singapore.\n",
      "6. Roti Prata. Indian pancakes usually eaten with curry or sugar. There's many different kinds, e.g. with egg/onions.\n",
      "7. Sambal Stingray. Stingray barbequed with sambal chilli (a spicy paste made of chilli, prawn paste, fish sauce etc.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Too many to list, most of them can be found in almost every hawker centre you go to. (Though if you want the best of each, you might need to travel to many different hawker centres.) Triuly: Gardens by the Bay is a must  azn099: Have to agree with the chili crab dish and Gardens by the Bay recs. Those are a must try/visit in SG.\n",
      "\n",
      "Only other thing I have to add is if you're food-adventurous, try frog porridge. There's a pretty popular place on Geylang that specializes in it. poisonedrainbows: go to gardens by the bay its worth it sigsin61: I think Marina Bay Sands is a good place to visit even though the shops there are quite expensive but it's worth a visit :)  EggPrata: They might want to get the standard tickets instead of the EZ-Link cards for short term train travel since they're less costly.
