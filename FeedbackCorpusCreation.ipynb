      "\n",
      "I personally would like to see the continuation of the series, but I do understand if Tom wants to mix it up. Perhaps it could work if there is more of a mix of different content being uploaded? I think it could be nice at least to see Tom have a go at the new Mass Transport dlc coming out soon, after the *spectacle* that is the rest of the public transport system...  darthmorf: [Poll results so far](http://www.strawpoll.me/12497391/r) EmperorJake: Whenever Tom does decide to end it, I'd like to see it replaced by another building game series - I'm sure Prison Architect would be fun, or maybe Factorio TommyAtkins_: For sure it shouldn't go on too long, this is a problem that absolutely plagues every series in the yogscast, dragging on without a clear end then just being forgotten about very suddenly. For me at least it makes series like DirtQuest and Druidz unwatchable because I know there's no pay-off to it all.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can see that series with proper story arcs, like Hat Films' Rust series, get more views and this series felt like it had arc. I'll admit now that it feels like it's petering out, the jokes don't come as thickly and I suspect that Tom's stringing himself along at certain points. Or rather I know that I always reach a point in Cities Skylines where I build things only because \"well I guess that should be there\".\n",
      "\n",
      "My suggestion wouldn't be to say \"50 episodes and that's all folks\", I'd say push it up to say 60, cos I don't don't think Tom's stunning work pace can take us to an appropriate end in that time. At least that's how I expect. I would also say that he should finish up the riverside industrial zone and then take a break for a while, and think specifically on how to finish up the rest of the riverside (for completions sake), and THEN in the last episodes of the series plan out and make Tech Island SUPER FANCY and packed with loads of details and special buildings (giant skyscrapers ofc).\n",
      "\n",

      "Stand out Tom. ptatoface: Tom, I don't know if you've been made aware of this since recording, but the tethers are a crucial part of the game that you're missing out on. To use them, all you have to do is put them in your inventory (not in the special slot that you put solar panels in) and press T to place them. Place the first one close enough to the base that you see a blue \"oxygen wire\" connected to it from the base. Then, you can connect a second tether to the first, a third to the second, and so on until you have a chain of them. If they're all connected, they should provide with oxygen (and energy if your base has it) in the same way that your base does. Basically, it means that you can explore for more than 20 seconds before having to run back to base for oxygen.\n",

More single player focused I love the editing that is currently on your channel. AngMod: I agree with you there.

To use them, all you have to do is put them in your inventory (not in the special slot that you put solar panels in) and press T to place them. Place the first one close enough to the base that you see a blue \"oxygen wire\" connected to it from the base. Then, you can connect a second tether to the first, a third to the second, and so on until you have a chain of them. If they're all connected, they should provide with oxygen (and energy if your base has it) in the same way that your base does. Basically, it means that you can explore for more than 20 seconds before having to run back to base for oxygen.\n",

More single player focused I love the editing that is currently on your channel. AngMod: I agree with you there.

I work, I simply don't have the time to watch hours and hours of streaming.\n",
      "\n",
      "On another note since you mentioned Sips, he was the first channel I subbed to and he brought me into most of what I like now but I unsubbed from his YouTube after he returned to playing Skyrim only to find out he had just cut down what he streamed. No fun editing like before, just more of an almost expressionless face in the bottom corner having conversations I can only hear half of. I utterly detest Twitch streams. I can't get involved in chat if I don't subscribe half the time and I can't follow the chat and pay attention to the video game at the same time. It also doesn't help when Sips is still hundreds of episodes into games like The Witcher which I have zero interest in but he can't be bothered to play anything else. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Chilluminati streams are almost the exception as you get four guys in a room talking to each other most of the time and not interacting with the other people on chat whom, no offence to you guys, are not the reason I started watching the Yogscast in the first place.\n",
      "\n",
      "I get it. I honestly understand why YouTubers are moving over to Twitch because Google is slowing making YouTube total dogshit that doesn't support the creators as much as it once did, but surely there is a compromise here somewhere. Why can't we have both streams and YouTube series? Why does it have to be one thing or another? I really feel like if I pop on YouTube it'll be to watch someone else with a \"channel update\" about how they are moving to Twitch and I have to simply find something else. \n",
      "\n",
      "All due respect to content creators of course. I don't want to sound entitled but I'm part of the audience to and as I mentioned I simply can't watch streams AND have a full time job.  thehildabeast: I get where your coming from, the reason it's like that is the money creators make isn't comparable. YouTube takes way more work for way less money so it makes sense for them to spend more time on twitch. That said I don't want to lose his YouTube channel either. TomtheCheeseFarmer: Tom addressed this on the yogscast subreddit, I've linked his comment, don't worry, looks like he'll be on Youtube as well for the foreseeable future. \n",

Melee attack and defence are just great at both beating down other heroes and protecting your hero mans from the attacks of the fodder.\n",

      "The red line is generally considered better for lords as it buffs your army, and legendary lords in particular tend to have unique skills in the top bar and the red branch that buff certain units - like Morgar's super-spawn or Volkmar's Ultra-Flagellants. It is however not as fun as having hitty-mc-hit-face basically solo an entire army.\n",

      "Blue line is also good, extra movement is really good, as is Lightning Strike. The horde armies also tend to have Horde Growth on their lords in the first set of blues, which is dull but almost always the first pick for a lot of people as it means you can sack more stuff, get more loot and recruit more mans.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's no absolutely best single path, it depends on the hero and the race. Generally hitty heroes want to be more hitty and supporty heroes want more buffs. Races like Chaos and Vampires excel at making their lords champions of combat, whereas Empire generally want to stick to army buffs as their lords just don't match up to the beatsticks of Chaos/Vampires.\n",

Zeratill: Toootally missed you'd replied!Probably too late but personally I like/went for the attacking spawn, I used about 8 of them as my line infantry later in the game and made sure I had some bestigors around to tie up any anti-large units (like halberdiers) and just charged the fuck out of anyone who came near me with cavalry and cygor support to deal with the flanks. Spawn are much more hitty than they are defendy, so generally you want to kill them before they can kill you as an approach. IIRC Morghur has a top row skill to give them missile resistance or a ward save though, which is an excellent pick because the main drawback of Spawn is how vulnerable they are to missile fire, especially from asshole Empire armies with a billion crossbowmans. So the resistance one from the top row, and the melee attack for spawn and monstrous infantry from the red row.' from subreddit: Angory_Tom\n",

The game allocates the appropriate amount of vehicles to a line automatically based on the usage, but Tom is using a mod that should make this work more efficiently and that he can override as necessary - so he doesn't absolutely need that reversed line, but it can still be a smart thing to add.  \n",

      "Stand out Tom. ptatoface: Tom, I don't know if you've been made aware of this since recording, but the tethers are a crucial part of the game that you're missing out on. To use them, all you have to do is put them in your inventory (not in the special slot that you put solar panels in) and press T to place them. Place the first one close enough to the base that you see a blue \"oxygen wire\" connected to it from the base. Then, you can connect a second tether to the first, a third to the second, and so on until you have a chain of them. If they're all connected, they should provide with oxygen (and energy if your base has it) in the same way that your base does. Basically, it means that you can explore for more than 20 seconds before having to run back to base for oxygen.\n",

More single player focused I love the editing that is currently on your channel. AngMod: I agree with you there.

In this video jakey’s friend was not that usual vlogger’s friend, but a normal guy. Someone who would get annoyed and call him out on the stupid shit he does in the video which is something that wouldn’t happen in a modern day vlog.

The reason I am considering to stop supporting the patreon is because it seems like you don’t really have a direction for the channel. At least in past videos you’ve stated the channel doesn’t really have a direction and it’s more of a side project to your music career/video career/game developer career?/whatever it is you end up doing. This on top of things like seeing you go to pax, buying a new camera, and just recently visiting New York makes me wonder if my money is actually going towards content on the channel. We get a video a week if we’re lucky and I feel that right now your channel doesn’t seem like an investment I should make. To end this I want to say that I love you more than anything Jakey and I will be a hot boy to my grave.

I agree with your observation about some songs having more meaning in their lyrics. After hearing saintlike, I'm convinced that he has a real knack for lyricism and we can probably expect much bigger things to come. So to sort of answer your question, I think his future music is probably going to clear this up for you, and carry some more meaning, more consistently. BayadOfficial: Saintlike is 100% about Jacob. I think the whole chorus was some sort of metaphor for his career/audience/idek but as a female. Many artists do this. Eminem puts \"hiphop\" into the character of a woman in 25 to life, for example. Taking it slow could mean he doesn't want to rush his career and success, but instead really connect with what he's creating. Thus, he's getting \"her\" mind' from subreddit: NakeyJakey\n",

At least in past videos you’ve stated the channel doesn’t really have a direction and it’s more of a side project to your music career/video career/game developer career?/whatever it is you end up doing. This on top of things like seeing you go to pax, buying a new camera, and just recently visiting New York makes me wonder if my money is actually going towards content on the channel.

A cautionary tale. roshdroz: Personally I think he's simply a young and new musician, still discovering the messages he wants to make, and when and where to make them. I agree with your observation about some songs having more meaning in their lyrics. After hearing saintlike, I'm convinced that he has a real knack for lyricism and we can probably expect much bigger things to come. So to sort of answer your question, I think his future music is probably going to clear this up for you, and carry some more meaning, more consistently. BayadOfficial: Saintlike is 100% about Jacob. I think the whole chorus was some sort of metaphor for his career/audience/idek but as a female. Many artists do this. Eminem puts \"hiphop\" into the character of a woman in 25 to life, for example. Taking it slow could mean he doesn't want to rush his career and success, but instead really connect with what he's creating. Thus, he's getting \"her\" mind' from subreddit: NakeyJakey\n",

Have you actively been trying to reduce that kind of behavior, or do you think there's been a natural shift in your community?

This code section protects your likeness (photograph, voice, name, signature, Etc.) from unauthorized use in commercial publication of any type (ie publishing on the internet for ad revenue). Under this code you could seek damages in the amount of $750 per occurrence, the cost of actual damages done, or any profits made from the unauthorized use.   \n",

      "Further, under the common law theory cause of action for appropriation of name or likeness may be pleaded by alleging \n",

      "(2) the appropriation of plaintiff's name or likeness to defendant's advantage, commercially or otherwise; \n",

      "You may also have a case to seek damages under the theory of \"Defamation\" (cal civ code 44 et seq) one of the requirements of defamation is publication so the video would have to have been publicly displayed somewhere. The upside to defamation is that it is a tort which allows punitive damages so you could ask the court to punish the defendant in an effort to discourage this kind of action in the future.  \n",
      "\n",
      "As for DMCA takedowns, there is an argument that could be made that your streaming persona is an original work of authorship which would be protected under US Copyright law (17 US Code Section 102 et seq) as it is likely an exaggerated character to your normal personality. Using this theory you can pursue action under the theory that you are protecting your \"original character\". I have done a little research into how this theory has been treated but it seems that it has had mixed results mostly based on whether a case could be made that the character is actually an original work of authorship as opposed to a \"Stock\" character but it should be enough to get a takedown notice, whether it sticks or not is another story. \n",
      "\n",
      "Both the DMCA and Defamation will come up against first amendment Free speech defenses to which you will need to make a case that it is in some way not a protected area of speech and that it is a false statement. If you can make an argument that it is in some way an act of hate speech against a protected group (ie Minority, women, sexual orientation, attack helicopters etc.). Additionally, you will need to be able to show actual damages (ie loss of income from lower viewers, loss of reputation) the issue with a twitch audience is that it would likely result in larger audiences which in turn will eliminate damages and create a situation of enrichment as a result. \n",

It just really did bug me watching that. Also thanks for the correction, I thought it was the police.  AoM336: Your problem goes beyond the issue of Kait at the hair salon. \n",
      "\n",
      "It sounds like you're expecting her to roll over and just accept the service that she's given. Or anyone for that matter. She's a paying customer! And this is an expensive up-scale salon.  Why would she (or anyone) pay for something that she didnt ask for and/or continually messed up? If it was merchandise she could just return it, but dying hair is more long term. And there's only so many things they can do to fix it before her hair falls apart. The salon got to that point failing every attempt to fix their mistake; even after being shown a picture of what she wanted. They can call the cops or security or ban her for a year, but I wouldn't expect anyone to sit there and be like, \"this is fine,\" when its so clearly not. \n",

      "As for your analogy, if a restaurant screws up your meal that many times they just allow you the free meal.

I do personally think the analogy isn't all that far off but that is of course open to interpretation.\n",
      "As for my lack of backbone perhaps it could use a bit of strengthening, so let me have it reddit. Hopefully I can take it ;) AoM336: Well that was a little terse of me. No way in hell I woulda paid for that dye job though. Like, if I had to sit with there with my wife for 10 hours while they fk'd her hair up, I know I'd be madder than hell. $200 AND my whole day? No way.  insignificantdaikini: I've never gotten off to her. I do however find her attractive and like her geeky personality but she is for certain over self inflated, self entitled and high on her horse. This episode I thought was a perfect demonstration of that and it truly did piss me off.  tenkini: while you are certainly entitled to your opinion I disagree with your restaurant metaphor.  What happened is she went into the salon and asked to get her hair done a specific way, showed pictures for a reference and sat down to let them provide the service  she had requested, they then proceeded to do something completely different,  they didn't give her the color she asked for originally because the stylist thought that the way she wanted to do it would look better, they didn't go the gradual blend from brown to blonde that she asked for and instead did a straight line, and they spent 1 hours continuing to not do what she had originally asked them to, so it's less like ordering something and then not liking it, as going to a restaurant and ordering a steak, and 70 minutes later they bring you soup, and then you remind them that's not what you asked for, so they send it back to the kitchen and another 70 minutes later they bring you pork, 99% of restaurants would comp your meal in this situation not call security and ban you from the premises.  That's my personal opinion on the situation, could she have handled it differently? sure. Was there potentially a \"better way\"? maybe. I also would mention that it's probably reasonable to be a little unhappy/snippy/critical with someone after they spend 10 hours of your time not doing the job you hired them for (that would normally take 3-6 hours if done properly the first time).  Feel free to call me a \"White Knight Cuck\" or whatever won't hurt my feelings any, that's just my view on the situation if you are interested in a second opinion/perspective slipperygash: And a pissed of wife to boot  Blakencakes: I missed that day. Wow lol  5n0rl4xm4573rr4c3: I mean let's not kid anyone the situation was sadly handled extremly poor on both sides and should not have been streamed period.

Sir1saac: its also making it quite a pain to scroll through my homepage on mobile real_dyeoxyde: I hate this mobile app so much. LUL youhadmeathey: I'm honestly just here for sexy pictures of her. Sir1saac: Yeah but there’s some people here who look at more then just this sub and don’t want there homepage clogged with mediocre clips youhadmeathey: Yeah I don't want those clips either, they're dumb real_dyeoxyde: Well now there's a post stickied for clips. So POST MOAR MEMES AND PICTURES AND EVERYTHING. CONTENT HOMIE! BabyRage Tripppnn: Its literally always the same guy. I dont get who could spend all their time doing that.  real_dyeoxyde: He's become the guy, solidchaos likes it. It feels like capturing moments to him. Sss_mithy: Yeah I just got to this sub and holy shit is it bad it scroll through. Sorry real_dyeoxyde: Funny enough it was Amouranth who told him to spam LUL Sss_mithy: Yeah not a great idea or at least have the clips of them doing....something, doesn't matter if it's sexual or not. But not just squatting lol  D3vil_0: I understand that the clips being spammed is hard for people to scroll through to see other things, but consolidating them into one message makes it even harder to find the clips you want to see so what about consolidating the clips to the day of the stream that they were taken from? Sir1saac: If they were in comments with a simple one sentence description you wouldn’t lose anything D3vil_0: You're not wrong xDagel, but remember SolidChaos can't edit the clip that easily while modding chat and the twitch clip editor isn't the easiest or precise thing to use, yes you can vary the length of the clip but actually capturing the moment you want isn't as easy, so taking multiple clips of the same instance is the easiest for him to do, that's why I also think it would be easier to consolidate them into messages of that stream of that specific day so people can find the clips they missed.\n",

D3vil_0: Do you mean putting a small description to explain what's going on before and or after the clip, that may not be as easy as it seems that would take SolidChaos quite a bit of time to do for all of his clips and since Amouranth streams so late he wouldn't have much time to do it with out giving up some sleep every night.\n",

D3vil_0:  I see what you're saying, But from the thumbnails the clips all look different, if any of them are the same clip posted more then once it may have been a mistake an if so tell SolidChaos and he can fix them.  xDagel: I know that the clips are different, but i don't see how 25 clips of squad squats is funny, even if they are different. But i'm gonna leave this thread. I deleted my comments, it's w/e.  S0LEPHaSR: Yeah, I said this same thing a while back, love SolidChaos' work, but this reddit is a lot better with the clips cleaned up. I get that you want posts in the reddit to increase your click count quick. My suggestion would be to compile clips from the whole days stream if possible as a highlights reel and post it as a youtube vid or sumthin too. I mean, when ammo streams the hours she does, if you miss a stream, nobody is going to have the time to go back and watch it all.

There is no doubt, she is beautiful.  To my surprise she is also talented.  She has an amazing voice when she sings, and her paintings are amazing.  She always has a smile and her ASMR has turned me into an ASMR fan.  She also works her butt off.  I can't believe how many hours she streams and all the work she puts into it.  She is so much more than a pretty face and rockin body.  I'm glad I gave her a chance.   TheCop03: That's the sad part.

TheCop03: Go look her up on patreon. You'll know what I'm talking about. Break_Bot72: Unfortunately the female hate demographic only makes up a portion of the whingers on that site \\(and just about everywhere to be fair\\). It doesn't take too much effort to find videos on youtube discussing the \"thot problem on twitch\" from the perspective of quite conservative types, that use the \"won't someone think of the children\" angle, as well as trying to make the whole thing into a selling of sexuality debate \\(I bet these idiots want all woman to dress like they do in the Handmaids Tale, because showing a little knee is an open invitation probably\\) \\- Ammo has been an easy target for them, so no wonder her name comes up in discussions. If anything, I've only seen her channel go from strength to strength since I started watching, and although I'm not massively into ASMR and the dancing, there is more than enough to keep me engaged when I do tune in, so for these people to point fingers and miss that she actually does have content that her followers like \\(and that there is a reason why she has a successful channel\\) displays nothing more than their own inhibitions and judgmental nature. Thankfully voices of positivity, much like your post, tend to drown out the negative arseholes that are out there, which not only makes her channel a better place for viewers, but I'm sure it rubs off on her too \\(makes it all the more worthwhile when people like what you do, I assume\\).

      "It sounds like you're expecting her to roll over and just accept the service that she's given. Or anyone for that matter. She's a paying customer! And this is an expensive up-scale salon.  Why would she (or anyone) pay for something that she didnt ask for and/or continually messed up? If it was merchandise she could just return it, but dying hair is more long term. And there's only so many things they can do to fix it before her hair falls apart. The salon got to that point failing every attempt to fix their mistake; even after being shown a picture of what she wanted. They can call the cops or security or ban her for a year, but I wouldn't expect anyone to sit there and be like, \"this is fine,\" when its so clearly not. \n",

I do personally think the analogy isn't all that far off but that is of course open to interpretation.\n",
      "As for my lack of backbone perhaps it could use a bit of strengthening, so let me have it reddit. Hopefully I can take it ;) AoM336: Well that was a little terse of me. No way in hell I woulda paid for that dye job though. Like, if I had to sit with there with my wife for 10 hours while they fk'd her hair up, I know I'd be madder than hell. $200 AND my whole day? No way.  insignificantdaikini: I've never gotten off to her. I do however find her attractive and like her geeky personality but she is for certain over self inflated, self entitled and high on her horse. This episode I thought was a perfect demonstration of that and it truly did piss me off.  tenkini: while you are certainly entitled to your opinion I disagree with your restaurant metaphor.  What happened is she went into the salon and asked to get her hair done a specific way, showed pictures for a reference and sat down to let them provide the service  she had requested, they then proceeded to do something completely different,  they didn't give her the color she asked for originally because the stylist thought that the way she wanted to do it would look better, they didn't go the gradual blend from brown to blonde that she asked for and instead did a straight line, and they spent 1 hours continuing to not do what she had originally asked them to, so it's less like ordering something and then not liking it, as going to a restaurant and ordering a steak, and 70 minutes later they bring you soup, and then you remind them that's not what you asked for, so they send it back to the kitchen and another 70 minutes later they bring you pork, 99% of restaurants would comp your meal in this situation not call security and ban you from the premises.  That's my personal opinion on the situation, could she have handled it differently? sure. Was there potentially a \"better way\"? maybe. I also would mention that it's probably reasonable to be a little unhappy/snippy/critical with someone after they spend 10 hours of your time not doing the job you hired them for (that would normally take 3-6 hours if done properly the first time).  Feel free to call me a \"White Knight Cuck\" or whatever won't hurt my feelings any, that's just my view on the situation if you are interested in a second opinion/perspective slipperygash: And a pissed of wife to boot  Blakencakes: I missed that day. Wow lol  5n0rl4xm4573rr4c3: I mean let's not kid anyone the situation was sadly handled extremly poor on both sides and should not have been streamed period.

      "Selected text: 'propstoammo: I'm a female streamer on Twitch and heard about certain streamers such as Amouranth.  I had a lot of negative feelings towards her and other female streamers on Twitch for the type of streaming they do.  Then with an open mind, I popped into one of Ammo's streams.  There is no doubt, she is beautiful.  To my surprise she is also talented.  She has an amazing voice when she sings, and her paintings are amazing.  She always has a smile and her ASMR has turned me into an ASMR fan.  She also works her butt off.  I can't believe how many hours she streams and all the work she puts into it.  She is so much more than a pretty face and rockin body.  I'm glad I gave her a chance.   TheCop03: That's the sad part. I genuinely believe she could have been a more popular steamer if she didn't do all her side dealings like that. She's an amazing streamer with great content but a lot of viewers doesnt watch her streams because of her other side ( including me to some extent). amouranth: \\&lt;33 real_dyeoxyde: Awesome to hear! I always encourage people to stick around and get to know her. I know how she comes off to a lot of people, glad you stuck around, I hope to see you in chat. &lt;3 duxbelorum28: Awesome that s great to read you gave her a chance and enjoy Ammo s streams AoM336: Whats this? Praise?! On Reddit? For Kait?  🤯\n",

      "Those are awesome things to say, welcome to the FAM! Chiakiichan: i found her through a gossip forum but i didnt even come to trash her i was just curious where all this hate come from. after a couple hours i followed because she is really entertaining and i dont understand the hate, probably jealous girls. im a girl too and we should uplift each other not hate Sowlid: IKR people make a wrong idea just because some streamers do the typical things for more viewers but Ammouranth nah she is really cool and entertainment I really love her streams she is so talent as you say her paints are so good blackXsquid: New to her, what \"other side\"? TheCop03: Go look her up on patreon. You'll know what I'm talking about. Break_Bot72: Unfortunately the female hate demographic only makes up a portion of the whingers on that site \\(and just about everywhere to be fair\\). It doesn't take too much effort to find videos on youtube discussing the \"thot problem on twitch\" from the perspective of quite conservative types, that use the \"won't someone think of the children\" angle, as well as trying to make the whole thing into a selling of sexuality debate \\(I bet these idiots want all woman to dress like they do in the Handmaids Tale, because showing a little knee is an open invitation probably\\) \\- Ammo has been an easy target for them, so no wonder her name comes up in discussions. If anything, I've only seen her channel go from strength to strength since I started watching, and although I'm not massively into ASMR and the dancing, there is more than enough to keep me engaged when I do tune in, so for these people to point fingers and miss that she actually does have content that her followers like \\(and that there is a reason why she has a successful channel\\) displays nothing more than their own inhibitions and judgmental nature. Thankfully voices of positivity, much like your post, tend to drown out the negative arseholes that are out there, which not only makes her channel a better place for viewers, but I'm sure it rubs off on her too \\(makes it all the more worthwhile when people like what you do, I assume\\). Captainweirdo54: Shes a fucking titty streamer those two speed humps are the only reason people watch her why do you think she draws in up to 2000 viewers just sitting in front on a backdrop with a low cut top on chatting shit?' from subreddit: Amouranth\n",

BatsNJokes: I am also curious about it. real_dyeoxyde: We believe what we want to believe, but she's not. iSuckMore: You're probably not wrong. Would explain a lot of things, like why her photos are always suggestive that she is naked but never shows anything. Surgery scars to hide some things that may have been changed. Penis used to be an outtie, now it's an innie for example. https://i.redd.it/nmknnxynu7701.png\n",
      " fingerandtoe: She definitely looks very boyish in that pic D3vil_0: In my attempt to answer your question respectfully, I raise the question do you consider Scarlett Johansson to look like a male to female transgendered person, because on multiple occasions virtually every stream she is constantly compared and inform that she looks and sounds like her.  mewantlove: Have you ever been outside? Women (and men, go figure) come in all shapes and sizes, some more feminine than others.... AoM336: You may not mean it, but it's still something you shouldn't ask either way. I think you just want someone to confirm your own biases.  fingerandtoe: Scarlett johanson has hips and natural breasts though. Amouranth doesn’t really have any hips and her boobs are plastic bolt ons.  fingerandtoe: It’s honestly hard to believe but i guess it’s not my place to say.  D3vil_0: So you do believe Scarlett Johansson is a male-to-female transgender person even though she's givin birth to a child or was that a grammatical error?\n",
      "\n",
      "Now as for your opinion that Amouranth doesn't have any hips compared to some of the Instagram models who have extremely large hips (that they work very hard for) well then that's just your opinion and you're welcome to it but it is still just your opinion not a fact, as for the comment of proclaiming she has fake breasts with out any real fact again is just your opinion, as of your comment of \"plastic bolt ons\" you are now going back on your word that you didn't want to be disrespectful, are you here just to troll or are you here to actually get some kind of realistic answer? fingerandtoe: Grammatical error, my bad. ScarJo is deffo a pure women. Look at the picture the other guy posted in the comments where amouranth has small boobs, she had implant for sure. Also you can’t work out to get bigger hips, it’s your pelvic bone structure. Men have narrow hips women have wide hips.  D3vil_0: Here are links to Amouranth's Instagram on the same night that the picture you are talking about was taken : https://www.instagram.com/p/BObbQWTAkkC/ &amp; https://www.instagram.com/p/BObIJhygIFE/ which was on Dec. 24th 2016, You can see her chest is small like like the menched pic, But here are IG post from 13 days before Dec. 11th '16 https://www.instagram.com/p/BN4mPzKA4bj/  and 3 days after Dec. 27 '16 https://www.instagram.com/p/BOh3d8GgpYo/ her breast change size because of the type of Bra she wears or for some cosplays she will wear a compression garment to hide her chest like when she was cosplaying Rey for Star Wars https://www.instagram.com/p/BRTiPIXDYDh/ &amp; https://www.instagram.com/p/Bcsz0C7nWnM/ ,  also you are correct hip bones themselves cannot be made larger, but there are exercises that can increase the muscles around the hips and buttocks an to reduce the size of the waist to increase the size of one's hips (example: https://www.femniqe.com/30-day-bigger-hips-challenge/), Which i do believe Amouranth maybe working on, but i'm not sure. fingerandtoe: Interesting, thanks for the info.  amouranth: In this thread D3vil learns people about how bras work.\n",

How about you make one post with all of the clips, I bet you’ll get more karma that way anyways. real_dyeoxyde: That's actually not a bad idea. Maybe would coerce more people into posting other memes. I want more memes. Sir1saac: its also making it quite a pain to scroll through my homepage on mobile real_dyeoxyde: I hate this mobile app so much. LUL youhadmeathey: I'm honestly just here for sexy pictures of her. Sir1saac: Yeah but there’s some people here who look at more then just this sub and don’t want there homepage clogged with mediocre clips youhadmeathey: Yeah I don't want those clips either, they're dumb real_dyeoxyde: Well now there's a post stickied for clips. So POST MOAR MEMES AND PICTURES AND EVERYTHING. CONTENT HOMIE! BabyRage Tripppnn: Its literally always the same guy. I dont get who could spend all their time doing that.  real_dyeoxyde: He's become the guy, solidchaos likes it. It feels like capturing moments to him. Sss_mithy: Yeah I just got to this sub and holy shit is it bad it scroll through. Sorry real_dyeoxyde: Funny enough it was Amouranth who told him to spam LUL Sss_mithy: Yeah not a great idea or at least have the clips of them doing....something, doesn't matter if it's sexual or not. But not just squatting lol  D3vil_0: I understand that the clips being spammed is hard for people to scroll through to see other things, but consolidating them into one message makes it even harder to find the clips you want to see so what about consolidating the clips to the day of the stream that they were taken from? Sir1saac: If they were in comments with a simple one sentence description you wouldn’t lose anything D3vil_0: You're not wrong xDagel, but remember SolidChaos can't edit the clip that easily while modding chat and the twitch clip editor isn't the easiest or precise thing to use, yes you can vary the length of the clip but actually capturing the moment you want isn't as easy, so taking multiple clips of the same instance is the easiest for him to do, that's why I also think it would be easier to consolidate them into messages of that stream of that specific day so people can find the clips they missed.\n",

      "But i could be wrong. D3vil_0: Do you mean putting a small description to explain what's going on before and or after the clip, that may not be as easy as it seems that would take SolidChaos quite a bit of time to do for all of his clips and since Amouranth streams so late he wouldn't have much time to do it with out giving up some sleep every night.\n",

D3vil_0:  I see what you're saying, But from the thumbnails the clips all look different, if any of them are the same clip posted more then once it may have been a mistake an if so tell SolidChaos and he can fix them.  xDagel: I know that the clips are different, but i don't see how 25 clips of squad squats is funny, even if they are different. But i'm gonna leave this thread. I deleted my comments, it's w/e.  S0LEPHaSR: Yeah, I said this same thing a while back, love SolidChaos' work, but this reddit is a lot better with the clips cleaned up. I get that you want posts in the reddit to increase your click count quick. My suggestion would be to compile clips from the whole days stream if possible as a highlights reel and post it as a youtube vid or sumthin too. I mean, when ammo streams the hours she does, if you miss a stream, nobody is going to have the time to go back and watch it all. So a clips/highlight reel each day is a \"Solid\" idea ;)' from subreddit: Amouranth\n",

BatsNJokes: I am also curious about it. real_dyeoxyde: We believe what we want to believe, but she's not. iSuckMore: You're probably not wrong. Would explain a lot of things, like why her photos are always suggestive that she is naked but never shows anything. Surgery scars to hide some things that may have been changed. Penis used to be an outtie, now it's an innie for example. https://i.redd.it/nmknnxynu7701.png\n",
      " fingerandtoe: She definitely looks very boyish in that pic D3vil_0: In my attempt to answer your question respectfully, I raise the question do you consider Scarlett Johansson to look like a male to female transgendered person, because on multiple occasions virtually every stream she is constantly compared and inform that she looks and sounds like her.  mewantlove: Have you ever been outside? Women (and men, go figure) come in all shapes and sizes, some more feminine than others.... AoM336: You may not mean it, but it's still something you shouldn't ask either way. I think you just want someone to confirm your own biases.  fingerandtoe: Scarlett johanson has hips and natural breasts though. Amouranth doesn’t really have any hips and her boobs are plastic bolt ons.  fingerandtoe: It’s honestly hard to believe but i guess it’s not my place to say.  D3vil_0: So you do believe Scarlett Johansson is a male-to-female transgender person even though she's givin birth to a child or was that a grammatical error?\n",

      "Now as for your opinion that Amouranth doesn't have any hips compared to some of the Instagram models who have extremely large hips (that they work very hard for) well then that's just your opinion and you're welcome to it but it is still just your opinion not a fact, as for the comment of proclaiming she has fake breasts with out any real fact again is just your opinion, as of your comment of \"plastic bolt ons\" you are now going back on your word that you didn't want to be disrespectful, are you here just to troll or are you here to actually get some kind of realistic answer? fingerandtoe: Grammatical error, my bad. ScarJo is deffo a pure women. Look at the picture the other guy posted in the comments where amouranth has small boobs, she had implant for sure. Also you can’t work out to get bigger hips, it’s your pelvic bone structure. Men have narrow hips women have wide hips.  D3vil_0: Here are links to Amouranth's Instagram on the same night that the picture you are talking about was taken : https://www.instagram.com/p/BObbQWTAkkC/ &amp; https://www.instagram.com/p/BObIJhygIFE/ which was on Dec. 24th 2016, You can see her chest is small like like the menched pic, But here are IG post from 13 days before Dec. 11th '16 https://www.instagram.com/p/BN4mPzKA4bj/  and 3 days after Dec. 27 '16 https://www.instagram.com/p/BOh3d8GgpYo/ her breast change size because of the type of Bra she wears or for some cosplays she will wear a compression garment to hide her chest like when she was cosplaying Rey for Star Wars https://www.instagram.com/p/BRTiPIXDYDh/ &amp; https://www.instagram.com/p/Bcsz0C7nWnM/ ,  also you are correct hip bones themselves cannot be made larger, but there are exercises that can increase the muscles around the hips and buttocks an to reduce the size of the waist to increase the size of one's hips (example: https://www.femniqe.com/30-day-bigger-hips-challenge/), Which i do believe Amouranth maybe working on, but i'm not sure. fingerandtoe: Interesting, thanks for the info.  amouranth: In this thread D3vil learns people about how bras work.\n",

      "Selected text: 'propstoammo: I'm a female streamer on Twitch and heard about certain streamers such as Amouranth.  I had a lot of negative feelings towards her and other female streamers on Twitch for the type of streaming they do.  Then with an open mind, I popped into one of Ammo's streams.  There is no doubt, she is beautiful.  To my surprise she is also talented.  She has an amazing voice when she sings, and her paintings are amazing.  She always has a smile and her ASMR has turned me into an ASMR fan.  She also works her butt off.  I can't believe how many hours she streams and all the work she puts into it.  She is so much more than a pretty face and rockin body.  I'm glad I gave her a chance.   TheCop03: That's the sad part. I genuinely believe she could have been a more popular steamer if she didn't do all her side dealings like that. She's an amazing streamer with great content but a lot of viewers doesnt watch her streams because of her other side ( including me to some extent). amouranth: \\&lt;33 real_dyeoxyde: Awesome to hear! I always encourage people to stick around and get to know her. I know how she comes off to a lot of people, glad you stuck around, I hope to see you in chat. &lt;3 duxbelorum28: Awesome that s great to read you gave her a chance and enjoy Ammo s streams AoM336: Whats this? Praise?! On Reddit? For Kait?  🤯\n",

      "Those are awesome things to say, welcome to the FAM! Chiakiichan: i found her through a gossip forum but i didnt even come to trash her i was just curious where all this hate come from. after a couple hours i followed because she is really entertaining and i dont understand the hate, probably jealous girls. im a girl too and we should uplift each other not hate Sowlid: IKR people make a wrong idea just because some streamers do the typical things for more viewers but Ammouranth nah she is really cool and entertainment I really love her streams she is so talent as you say her paints are so good blackXsquid: New to her, what \"other side\"? TheCop03: Go look her up on patreon. You'll know what I'm talking about. Break_Bot72: Unfortunately the female hate demographic only makes up a portion of the whingers on that site \\(and just about everywhere to be fair\\). It doesn't take too much effort to find videos on youtube discussing the \"thot problem on twitch\" from the perspective of quite conservative types, that use the \"won't someone think of the children\" angle, as well as trying to make the whole thing into a selling of sexuality debate \\(I bet these idiots want all woman to dress like they do in the Handmaids Tale, because showing a little knee is an open invitation probably\\) \\- Ammo has been an easy target for them, so no wonder her name comes up in discussions. If anything, I've only seen her channel go from strength to strength since I started watching, and although I'm not massively into ASMR and the dancing, there is more than enough to keep me engaged when I do tune in, so for these people to point fingers and miss that she actually does have content that her followers like \\(and that there is a reason why she has a successful channel\\) displays nothing more than their own inhibitions and judgmental nature. Thankfully voices of positivity, much like your post, tend to drown out the negative arseholes that are out there, which not only makes her channel a better place for viewers, but I'm sure it rubs off on her too \\(makes it all the more worthwhile when people like what you do, I assume\\). Captainweirdo54: Shes a fucking titty streamer those two speed humps are the only reason people watch her why do you think she draws in up to 2000 viewers just sitting in front on a backdrop with a low cut top on chatting shit?' from subreddit: Amouranth\n",

Mr_Popper: Sound is off by like 2 seconds... I like KKG but Suzy's got to work on that. NotTheCinemassacre: Okay, so I live in the Netherlands and know nothing about what you can't say in the US, so why does \"cunt\" needs to be censored? Why is that word worse than other words?  jkubed: Honestly, no clue. I don't understand why the line was drawn where it was, but it seems most people think that cunt is the one swear word to be afraid of other than racial slurs. People are just overly sensitive here sometimes. NotTheCinemassacre: The thing is, the Dutch word for cunt is the same thing as fuck is for Americans, so I think it's pretty funny that there's such a big difference between languages. Thanks for clearing it up! Gralkor: While although I am a \"dyed-in-the-wool\" liberal hippie feminist, I miss the days when the only thing that would be censored on Game Grumps was things like nigger.

Lilypichu has been a favorite YouTuber and streamer of mine for a long a time. I’ve had a lot of fun interacting with her occasionally and just being a part of her awesome community. I was thinking about it the other day and thought about all the great times I had because of what she does. So I decided to write a letter of appreciation and I want to send it to her directly instead of in public.\n",

The problem with this though is I have no idea how I would be able to sent it to her because there are no sources on her social media for me to send a fan letter to her. She does have a business email though, but I’m not going to use that to send her this fan letter because it’s not a business letter. I have tried to reach her through a public post on Twitter asking how I would be able to send it to her directly, but she hasn’t responded.\n",

      "The reason I want to send it to her directly is because I’m embarrassed about public posts and everything.

Yeah he is cute, smart and amazing in all aspects , but perhaps i should stop living a dream of thinking that Destiny is this actually intelligent and can debate. He now spends a lot of time talking about weeb shit like Attack on Titans and playing those awful waifu games like Lords Mobile The truth sucks so much but ever since he and TigerLily (The better lily btw) broke up he hasn't been fixed.
