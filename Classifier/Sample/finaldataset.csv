Anyway, I lurk and watch Ninja's stream periodically and he usually seems like a pretty stand up guy apart from the usual trash talk. But this video makes me feel bad for this small streamer, that Ninja would get his hopes up and then ghost him. I wouldn't just blindly believe it happened but then he posts evidence of it.

I don't know I think Ninja should reach out because this might turn people off of the stream. mothehedgehog: yes                                                                                                                                                                                 TheMusicFella: Can someone TL;DR this?

dw0qrx2,NinjasHyper,Ninja on live television,"BroxigarZ: I like how PC Gamer and other outlets are talking about how he makes $500,000 a month and it sounds like a lot, but in reality that is so so small. First that's before taxes and taxes hurt these streamers more than anything because they HAVE TO file these as tips and massive chunks of their income are given back come tax season.

Beyond that - look at situations like singers for instance take drake. His sign on contract is probably 25 million and he only has to do a tour every few years and drop a CD once every 2 or so. That's 5 years of Ninja grinding just as a sign on. Drake sells out a stadium once maybe a month on a tour cycle Ninja has more than double that stadiums viewers daily.

Ninja is by far The tops when it comes to streaming so lets look at the tops of another sport - say boxing - another individual sport. Floyd Mayweather for a single fight gets $100 million dollars pre-fight and before sponsorships.

That is almost 20 years of Ninja having to stay on top of Twitch....20 years...in retrospect for the amount of viewers he maintains - SOLD OUT stadiums worth daily - he makes literally ass when it comes to money compared to other markets that do far less.

Amazon doesn't pay him nearly enough, Twitch doesn't pay him nearly enough, and sponsors aren't picking up these streamers as much as they could.

Seriously a billionaire could come along and start a streaming llc. And just pay the top 10 twitch streamers record label dollar amounts and seriously put a hurt on Twitch. And in time It will happen and you will have competing ""labels"" fighting for these streamers.

Right now tho $500,000 is fucking pennies compared to the entertainment industry standards. joeymia: You think Drake gets to keep that 25 million? He has to pay his army of employees, managers, lawyers, entourage and taxes just like Ninja. No one is going to be willing to pay a couple hundred and even thousands of dollars to watch Ninja play for an hour or two like at Drake concerts.

Floyd analogy is even more flawed. He makes his money because he has millions of PPV buys at $100. He's also bringing in millions of dollars the night of the event at the gate. 

Ninja is making this money mostly off amazon prime. Which is mostly ""free"". People are either using free trials or they already utilize amazon prime for the other benefits so its not really coming out of their pocket. Other artists and performers you are talking about actually have millions of people spending hundreds on them. Ninja is not even close or on the same level.  bastiVS: Apples and oranges my dude.

Ninjas viewers dont matter jack shit here, because his stream is not just free, but also super easily accessible from your PC or phone. Barrier of entry is literally nonexistant, and his cash comes from Subs, prime and donations. 

Music industry celebs have a much, much much larger following that ninja, and one that knows that it is expected to fork over cash for concers, singles and other stuff. 

Basically means:

People who are willing to spend their money for pretty much no return (You get nothing from sending cash to Ninja), versus people who have to spend cash to even have any access to what they want to consume (music). 

So even if you have 10k people in a stadium to a concert, you cant compare that to the 10k watching a streamer. You only could if either the stream was pay to view, or the concert completly free (and in front of your house, because travel is nessesary for concerts). BroxigarZ: You don't think Ninja's impact drives up the value of Twitch / Ad Revenue / Amazon Prime Subscriptions?

Come on man, you can't bitch about driving sales in other industries and not think Ninja drives sales for the companies he is under. BroxigarZ: My overall point is $6 mil a year pre-tax is literally jack shit in the entertainment industry. It's getting hyped like it's a lot, but seriously Ninja's value in any other medium would be multiplicatively more.

You could argue streaming is a new market, but I think the understanding from some of these gaming outlets is ridiculous flaunting $500K a month like it's a substantial amount of money. It truly is not in the market he is in. It's generally pennies.  joeymia: Of course he does but is he on the level of Mayweather or Drake. Not even close.  youarebrotherHH: It‚Äôs getting hyped up a lot because he plays video games for a living. I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs not hard, but he doesn‚Äôt have to have marketers, writers, producers, all that shit. In the entertainment industry, 6 mil is not Jack shit. Not even close. Yes, drake makes more, Kendrick makes more, 50 makes more, but think of all of the people that don‚Äôt make nearly that. Any average sports player, any pop/rap/country artist who isn‚Äôt A-list. They had to work their whole lives for that shit, he didn‚Äôt. That‚Äôs the difference. You compare the biggest celebrities in the world to a 20-something year old pro gamer, and yeah he is going to seem insignificant. But compare him to any artist who wasn‚Äôt lucky enough to be signed by Young Money and he‚Äôs a fucking god.",BroxigarZ,"You don't think Ninja's impact drives up the value of Twitch / Ad Revenue / Amazon Prime Subscriptions?

We recently saw this with myth fans coming out in the hundreds and harassing fedmyster in a pokimane stream chat when they were streaming together.  And ninjas fan base is much bigger than myths.   Saint__14: I mean, honestly, how could anyone expect him to cross streams with girls. They don't even pee standing up! Crowgora_: That is one way to look at it. But what if, now hear me out, that female streamer knew the risk and still wanted to take that risk? Ninja has a huge audience and knows he can impact other peoples careers. 

His first response to this whole mess should have been, ""I do not want to bring negativity to other channels or harassment"" not, I will not play with female streamers. His first statement makes it look like his relationship is not stable, and in general, he/her both struggle with fidelity issues. 

I can respect the second statement, but it is very reactionary.  McBoregano: It's his relationship and personal business and the amount of entitlement from these female streamers is amazing. No one *deserves* a chance to stream with him. If he doesn't want to he shouldn't be obligated to. Why is this even a discussion? Crowgora_: Oh, i do agree. But, there are different ways to answer the question that the lead to that answer. The way he answers provokes drama, articles, and people questioning his intentions.

Like, is he so worried that his wife might misconstrue every action on stream? He could have just said that he would play with any streamer if the opportunity arises and left it at that.

Im not a ninja fan, but i like his stort and journey so far. I find it interesting seeing him develop and grow his brand.

But he needs a pr guy at some point. McBoregano: His wife is his PR guy. So, uh I wouldn't want to deal with rumours about my partner even if it weren't true. It doesn't matter how strong their relationship is. People calling it fragile are way out of line.

In college someone claimed I raped my girlfriend. I didn't. Because I didn't do anything I shouldn't have felt bad about it? It still hurt to be the object of speculation regardless of the validity.",Crowgora_,"Oh, i do agree. But, there are different ways to answer the question that the lead to that answer.

I‚Äôm done with them for now. Hopefully he‚Äôll realize what he‚Äôs done and start playing with the doc again. He owes it to him.  BraveDave1: clip missing, what was it? ftwin: Honestly man this whole ""spread positivity "" thing is just an act from Ninja that he started when his channel blew up.  He's also been a little whiny arrogant asshole every since I've been watching him (since the old Halo days).  You can see it break through sometimes when someone kills him in Fortnite he'll let something slip every now and then.  But he knows he can't act like that in front of all these viewers so he's trying to change his image but trust me it's not genuine. samwich3090: watch any old halo clips and you see his genuine persona tplee: I mean he could at least say something professional, like guys don‚Äôt go over to another streamers channel and talk shit. It wouldn‚Äôt completely stop things but it would improve it. When Kraftyy killed him the other day I bunch of ninja people flooded Kraftyy chat and just started talking shit for no reason. Anyone who has watched Kraftyy knows that 

A. He‚Äôs arguably as good as ninja at fortnite. Might even be better. Ninja is a little flashier though.

B. Is the nicest streamer you will ever watch. He didn‚Äôt deserve that.

Tunavi: So he just cut them all off? That's fine but did he acknowledge this to the community? I'm a casual ninja fan, I tune in weekly but not every day so I'm not up to date on his stream policies Knickerbockerstape: Nah he gets to them when he can, sometimes it just takes a few games...maybe even an hr then he‚Äôll read a bunch off. There‚Äôs just so many now that he can‚Äôt do it as often otherwise he‚Äôd never get to play the game.  Jhonathan503: He always says its hard to keep up.  blockba5her: He still tries to make the stream entertaining, while streaming up to 12 hours a day, with 100k people watching almost all of the time. You can image how hard that must be on him, and with everyone trying to donate to him, it's too much. I'm sure he appreciates all of the donations, subscriptions, and twitch bits he receives.

He also tries to do this all while responding to TV interviews and podcasts. sedapSfOecA: The past few weeks he's been taking part in tournaments, so reads chat/donos/subs less because he's trying to focus on the game (20k prize pool for the tourney). That could be it. Tunavi: Thanks. smcmahon710: I kinda feel like he doesn't enjoy what he does as much. He used to give out advice about the game interact with donate\-rs etc. It seems like money is his number one thing right now which I can respect as well  Lextron: He specifically said that there's too many subs to read them out loud these days-  can't confirm what he's said regarding any other lack-of-chat-interaction Tunavi: Thank you",Tunavi,Thank you,0,Male,NinjasHyper,e0e4wtz,8oaal1,12,1,2.6390573296152584

dw0jqf4,NinjasHyper,Ninja on live television,"BroxigarZ: I like how PC Gamer and other outlets are talking about how he makes $500,000 a month and it sounds like a lot, but in reality that is so so small. First that's before taxes and taxes hurt these streamers more than anything because they HAVE TO file these as tips and massive chunks of their income are given back come tax season.

Beyond that - look at situations like singers for instance take drake. His sign on contract is probably 25 million and he only has to do a tour every few years and drop a CD once every 2 or so. That's 5 years of Ninja grinding just as a sign on. Drake sells out a stadium once maybe a month on a tour cycle Ninja has more than double that stadiums viewers daily.

Ninja is by far The tops when it comes to streaming so lets look at the tops of another sport - say boxing - another individual sport. Floyd Mayweather for a single fight gets $100 million dollars pre-fight and before sponsorships.

That is almost 20 years of Ninja having to stay on top of Twitch....20 years...in retrospect for the amount of viewers he maintains - SOLD OUT stadiums worth daily - he makes literally ass when it comes to money compared to other markets that do far less.

Amazon doesn't pay him nearly enough, Twitch doesn't pay him nearly enough, and sponsors aren't picking up these streamers as much as they could.

Seriously a billionaire could come along and start a streaming llc. And just pay the top 10 twitch streamers record label dollar amounts and seriously put a hurt on Twitch. And in time It will happen and you will have competing ""labels"" fighting for these streamers.

Right now tho $500,000 is fucking pennies compared to the entertainment industry standards. joeymia: You think Drake gets to keep that 25 million? He has to pay his army of employees, managers, lawyers, entourage and taxes just like Ninja. No one is going to be willing to pay a couple hundred and even thousands of dollars to watch Ninja play for an hour or two like at Drake concerts.

Floyd analogy is even more flawed. He makes his money because he has millions of PPV buys at $100. He's also bringing in millions of dollars the night of the event at the gate. 

Ninja is making this money mostly off amazon prime. Which is mostly ""free"". People are either using free trials or they already utilize amazon prime for the other benefits so its not really coming out of their pocket. Other artists and performers you are talking about actually have millions of people spending hundreds on them. Ninja is not even close or on the same level.  bastiVS: Apples and oranges my dude.

Ninjas viewers dont matter jack shit here, because his stream is not just free, but also super easily accessible from your PC or phone. Barrier of entry is literally nonexistant, and his cash comes from Subs, prime and donations. 

Music industry celebs have a much, much much larger following that ninja, and one that knows that it is expected to fork over cash for concers, singles and other stuff. 

Basically means:

People who are willing to spend their money for pretty much no return (You get nothing from sending cash to Ninja), versus people who have to spend cash to even have any access to what they want to consume (music). 

So even if you have 10k people in a stadium to a concert, you cant compare that to the 10k watching a streamer. You only could if either the stream was pay to view, or the concert completly free (and in front of your house, because travel is nessesary for concerts). BroxigarZ: You don't think Ninja's impact drives up the value of Twitch / Ad Revenue / Amazon Prime Subscriptions?

Come on man, you can't bitch about driving sales in other industries and not think Ninja drives sales for the companies he is under. BroxigarZ: My overall point is $6 mil a year pre-tax is literally jack shit in the entertainment industry. It's getting hyped like it's a lot, but seriously Ninja's value in any other medium would be multiplicatively more.

You could argue streaming is a new market, but I think the understanding from some of these gaming outlets is ridiculous flaunting $500K a month like it's a substantial amount of money. It truly is not in the market he is in. It's generally pennies.  joeymia: Of course he does but is he on the level of Mayweather or Drake. Not even close.  youarebrotherHH: It‚Äôs getting hyped up a lot because he plays video games for a living. I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs not hard, but he doesn‚Äôt have to have marketers, writers, producers, all that shit. In the entertainment industry, 6 mil is not Jack shit. Not even close. Yes, drake makes more, Kendrick makes more, 50 makes more, but think of all of the people that don‚Äôt make nearly that. Any average sports player, any pop/rap/country artist who isn‚Äôt A-list. They had to work their whole lives for that shit, he didn‚Äôt. That‚Äôs the difference. You compare the biggest celebrities in the world to a 20-something year old pro gamer, and yeah he is going to seem insignificant. But compare him to any artist who wasn‚Äôt lucky enough to be signed by Young Money and he‚Äôs a fucking god.",bastiVS,"Apples and oranges my dude.

Just because the caption has a stupid face doesn't make it good. GazSua: Ninja is one of the largest entertainers on the planet right now and has quite an eccentric personality.  Twitter is a cesspool.

Add those two things together, and you get a seemingly countless amount of trolls and haters.  Don't worry about it.  The fact is that for every troll on Twitter, there are 100,000 people silently supporting Ninja.

Anyway, I lurk and watch Ninja's stream periodically and he usually seems like a pretty stand up guy apart from the usual trash talk. But this video makes me feel bad for this small streamer, that Ninja would get his hopes up and then ghost him. I wouldn't just blindly believe it happened but then he posts evidence of it.

I don't know I think Ninja should reach out because this might turn people off of the stream. mothehedgehog: yes                                                                                                                                                                                 TheMusicFella: Can someone TL;DR this? Thanks! hankikanto: Basically this guy had made a video a bit ago that went viral about how streaming has negatively affected his life, the day that video dropped he was streaming and Ninja came into his chat and said ‚ÄúI resonate a lot with your video, if you ever want to play Fortnite hit me up‚Äù. The guy in the video tried but couldn‚Äôt reach him, then someone donated to Ninja telling him to play Fortnite with the guy he responded with ‚ÄúI‚Äôm pretty sure that guy gave up on streaming.‚Äù  TheMusicFella: Thank you!

dbwhoaz,Angory_Tom,Astroneer - ANOMALIES - Part #3,"ragedogg69: Since he asked at the end of the video here are my thoughts on the editing:

I prefer more editing.  It does not have to be North Side High levels of editing.  I know this will mean shorter or less frequent videos, but youtube is full of low effort lets plays.  What drew me to Tom is his editing.  I know minutes watched is the big deal on youtube now, but I think all these youtubers that throw a low effort ""completes"" series for easy minute viewed is not the answer.

Stand out Tom. ptatoface: Tom, I don't know if you've been made aware of this since recording, but the tethers are a crucial part of the game that you're missing out on. To use them, all you have to do is put them in your inventory (not in the special slot that you put solar panels in) and press T to place them. Place the first one close enough to the base that you see a blue ""oxygen wire"" connected to it from the base. Then, you can connect a second tether to the first, a third to the second, and so on until you have a chain of them. If they're all connected, they should provide with oxygen (and energy if your base has it) in the same way that your base does. Basically, it means that you can explore for more than 20 seconds before having to run back to base for oxygen.

Also, when you get energy in item form by sucking up enough of the yellow crystals, it acts like a non-rechargable battery. You can plug it into anywhere you can put solar panels for quick energy.

On the question of editing, I think that it isn't really needed very much when playing multiplayer, and can be cut down a bit in singleplayer. For example, I personally wouldn't mind that much if you didn't do the thing where you show a picture of something whenever you say it, like trains in the recent Cities: Skylines episodes. mr_mallen: I'm probably echoing most peoples comments on youtube and reddit - prefer the highly editted because it sets tom apart but both styles are welcome. 
Another thing i'm really liking is that tom is working hard to make his viewers a part of his channel. I hope he keeps this going as his channel grows. The_WubWub: With this series since it is so multiplayer focus I do not mind less editing as the multiplayer is an effort in itself. More single player focused I love the editing that is currently on your channel. AngMod: I agree with you there. If he posted a larger ratio of multiplayer to solo content, and less editing got put into the multiplayer videos, it would help give Tom the time to edit those solo videos, whilst we still get content from him.",mr_mallen,"I'm probably echoing most peoples comments on youtube and reddit - prefer the highly editted because it sets tom apart but both styles are welcome.

dctwmlz,Angory_Tom,Cities Skylines - Perfect Metro - Part #29,"Driftwood_06: That traffic by the metro/train station.... Seems like it's gonna be a future Tom problem 

Also, that edit with all the different people of the city was absolutely hilarious. Afreeusernameihope: Yeah...Many cars. 

Also, the slip road into the Slag Town industrial area is really busy, maybe try splitting the traffic? Rad_Carrot: I'm late to the comment party, but just wanted to give my tuppence on the metro system.

Overall, it's not bad! The 'triangle junctions' are a little close together and need to be stretched out, and some of the lines don't exactly make lots of sense.  Each line should connect residential zones with either commercial or industrial zones, preferably both, but I'm not so sure all the lines are doing that - the stations were plonked down a little haphazardly.  I think most of them seem fine, though, and the fact it seems to be nice and busy is a good sign.

It's best to put metro stations next to bus and tram stops and train stations, and also next to big draws like schools, universities and tourist attractions.  The Courthouse (COURTHOUSE) Cosmopolitan Station is a good call, as was the train station one.  

If Tom sorted out his bus and tram lines (he needs a lot more) and got over his phobia of making bicycle and walking paths, he could take a lot of traffic off the road.  As it is, he's got around 10% of the population using his public transport.  A good figure to aim for is *at least* 20%, although I generally aim for 40% and higher in the cities I make.

Still, the traffic actually isn't too bad.  A bit of congestion here and there, but there's no mile-long tailbacks anywhere.  Yet.  That can be another problem for Future Tom. Angor_is_Angory: I really value comments like these! Dont be afraid to call me out on my terrible plays. Also dont be surprised if I get distracted when trying to carry out any changes...

dsv3nly,Angory_Tom,Welcome to Mama's House - They Are Billions - Part 1,"vinewood: Not sure you need more advice but here I go:

1. City planning is important, you want to make the best of the Bank and Market ranges, so plan acordingly
2. Snipers are really strong, a ball of 18 snipers can pretty much clear the entire map for you.
3. Expansion is the name of the game, it is almost never profitable to make any advanced buildings. just build more of the standard buildings as you expand your colony to span the entire map.
4. You should never stop growing. Standard goals I make for myself are 200 colonists at day 10, 400 at day 20 and from there its pretty much a Exponential growth (last mayor around day 40, and 2500 to 3000 colonists when the final wave happens)
5. Get your first soldier to vetran asap (you need to kill 100 zombies) on the first 3 maps this is really strong because a soldier can easily clear the zombies up to executives if he doesnt get overwhelmed (he can outrun everything except for harpies so that shouldnt be a problem)
ps: Dont do this too close to the base you need some space to kite the zombs

Hope that was usefull
The game is a LOT of fun but you have to stay ahead of the curve to have a shot at the final wave.

Soma's no monsters mode because its great otherwise for something short you could give Dear Esther a look, pretty similar to layers of fear tho only about an hour long. 
Theres also Firewatch which could work or Vanishing of Ethan Carter although I can imagine the two of you getting a bit stuck on some of the more annoying puzzles.

Rad_Carrot: I'd loved to have gone to a school across the road from a rollercoaster.  But the kids from the city of Nowhere may not need that distraction, given that there's about a thousand of them not able to attend primary/elementary school.

Nowhere does seem to be doing better than Lakewood/Chaipan - Tom added almost 4k to his population this episode, while Sjin has barely hit that 12 episodes in.  Apart from a little traffic trouble, the city looks pretty good.  When the new parts are filled in it'll look amazing, even if half the city is lit by the blazing fires of New Poosbury.

I'd still recommend Tom takes a look at the public transport links, and maybe try and fix that traffic jam.  He could always ban heavy traffic from the Greenleaf town centre and build a ring road outside of the district, encouraging all trucks to take a detour around the outside of town.  Or just add a better connection to the highway from the industry.

dbx41mq,Angory_Tom,Astroneer - ANOMALIES - Part #3,"ragedogg69: Since he asked at the end of the video here are my thoughts on the editing:

I prefer more editing.  It does not have to be North Side High levels of editing.  I know this will mean shorter or less frequent videos, but youtube is full of low effort lets plays.  What drew me to Tom is his editing.  I know minutes watched is the big deal on youtube now, but I think all these youtubers that throw a low effort ""completes"" series for easy minute viewed is not the answer.

Stand out Tom. ptatoface: Tom, I don't know if you've been made aware of this since recording, but the tethers are a crucial part of the game that you're missing out on. To use them, all you have to do is put them in your inventory (not in the special slot that you put solar panels in) and press T to place them. Place the first one close enough to the base that you see a blue ""oxygen wire"" connected to it from the base. Then, you can connect a second tether to the first, a third to the second, and so on until you have a chain of them. If they're all connected, they should provide with oxygen (and energy if your base has it) in the same way that your base does. Basically, it means that you can explore for more than 20 seconds before having to run back to base for oxygen.

Also, when you get energy in item form by sucking up enough of the yellow crystals, it acts like a non-rechargable battery. You can plug it into anywhere you can put solar panels for quick energy.

On the question of editing, I think that it isn't really needed very much when playing multiplayer, and can be cut down a bit in singleplayer. For example, I personally wouldn't mind that much if you didn't do the thing where you show a picture of something whenever you say it, like trains in the recent Cities: Skylines episodes. mr_mallen: I'm probably echoing most peoples comments on youtube and reddit - prefer the highly editted because it sets tom apart but both styles are welcome. 
Another thing i'm really liking is that tom is working hard to make his viewers a part of his channel. I hope he keeps this going as his channel grows. The_WubWub: With this series since it is so multiplayer focus I do not mind less editing as the multiplayer is an effort in itself. More single player focused I love the editing that is currently on your channel. AngMod: I agree with you there. If he posted a larger ratio of multiplayer to solo content, and less editing got put into the multiplayer videos, it would help give Tom the time to edit those solo videos, whilst we still get content from him.",The_WubWub,With this series since it is so multiplayer focus I do not mind less editing as the multiplayer is an effort in itself.

6yku5a,Angory_Tom,Starbound help(?),"TheFoxingUser: might as well post because it'll help you guys a lot since it's pretty much bullshit :P

you can basically ignore every other weapon that isn't a throwable weapon or utility by making hunting spears and when you do bosses use the more ""expensive"" throwing weapons.

you can also split your stack of throwing weapons and use them in 2 hands essentially creating a tier 7 (max is 6) 2 handed weapon with melee dps at ranged.

starbound's balance in weapons is pretty fucking sad when one of the first ITEMS you encounter in the game is one of the best weapons for your entire playthrough.

i was still using hunting spears on the 5th tier boss until i had enough of other looted throwable items to just replace them. it's not much of a downside when you get them in quantities of ""shitloads"" if you're not missing 9/10 of them.

the other weapon to mention is ""utility"" ones which you've already acquired one of them being the iron broadsword which essentially gives you a double jump, and triple when you've got the actual double jump.

other ""utility"" weapons to look out for is durasteel broadsword (gives you flight for energy) , energy aura mace (light, damage aura to break traps by running by) and broadswords with ""trail rush"" which uses your energy to go a long distance forward very fast (great for running back to esther 20 times for quests).",TheFoxingUser,"might as well post because it'll help you guys a lot since it's pretty much bullshit :P

dsv3nly,Angory_Tom,Welcome to Mama's House - They Are Billions - Part 1,"vinewood: Not sure you need more advice but here I go:

1. City planning is important, you want to make the best of the Bank and Market ranges, so plan acordingly
2. Snipers are really strong, a ball of 18 snipers can pretty much clear the entire map for you.
3. Expansion is the name of the game, it is almost never profitable to make any advanced buildings. just build more of the standard buildings as you expand your colony to span the entire map.
4. You should never stop growing. Standard goals I make for myself are 200 colonists at day 10, 400 at day 20 and from there its pretty much a Exponential growth (last mayor around day 40, and 2500 to 3000 colonists when the final wave happens)
5. Get your first soldier to vetran asap (you need to kill 100 zombies) on the first 3 maps this is really strong because a soldier can easily clear the zombies up to executives if he doesnt get overwhelmed (he can outrun everything except for harpies so that shouldnt be a problem)
ps: Dont do this too close to the base you need some space to kite the zombs

Hope that was usefull

I don't want this series to end at all but I completely understand if Tom feels it needs to.  Getting to fifty episodes on a solo building series is good going.  It could always go on hiatus for a while, while Tom plays other games - but it's up to him.

I'm still not sure what the problem is in the city, but somehow the goods aren't getting into the areas which is messing up the supply and demand - it's why Greenleaf wasn't growing.  My personal feeling is that it's got something to do with the cargo station still, but I'm not certain - perhaps there's a modded building that's messing with the cargo instead. tbakke: Tom:

Count to 10 when angry

To cool off a hot head, count to 10 and take a slow, deep breath between each number. This simple technique may help tame your temper and short-circuit a quick fuse.

‚ÄúBreath is one of the most powerful tools we have, and it‚Äôs one of the easiest ways to get present in the moment,‚Äù

Anger is a weakness but people think of it as a strength. In actuality, the person who does not display anger has more inner strength than the one who displays it. First, the sparks set you on fire and then you burn others. So, that fire not only hurts you, but hurts others as well.

Is there any way how to manage anger? Yes! With these anger management techniques you can become free from the bondage of anger. Do you get angry or it just happens? It just happens. So anger, is in fact, an effect. How can you stop an effect? It is the same as the result of an examination. The result cannot be changed. It is the cause which you need to change. As long as there is a cause, there will be an effect.

TipsHolic has revealed various causes of anger, which has helped many people learn about anger management. Once you identify the different causes of anger, you can start to deal with them, even before they result in anger.

Analyse how to manage anger with this new understanding on anger management, and bring an end to all your confusion and frustration.

Taking slow, deep breaths helps to switch the nervous system from a ‚Äúfight or flight‚Äù sympathetic system response, to a ‚Äúrest and digest‚Äù parasympathetic system response instead, making you feel more mellow and relaxed.

Be happy Grandpa_Edd: You might have gotten a bit confused. This is subreddit for fans of a youtuber named Tom whose name on youtube is Angor. While the name did come from someone getting angry the subreddit has nothing to do with anger. (well maybe some slight frustrations if he does something stupid in a game)

Tom himself is very much not a angry person. Or at least doesn't appear to be.

Good you are trying to help people but you're in the wrong place.

Unless it's joke post but looking at your account (which apparently was made about 4 hours ago) I don't think it is. Aidan357: This is the second best shitposting bot I've ever seen. fragglerawker: What the actual shit posting fuck?",tipsholic,"Count to 10 (or beyond) when angry

Like it seems like it's meant to be funny, but some of the lyrics near the end make me think it has some sort of deeper meaning. sasiawastaken: I don't know about the first question, but I'm pretty sure Saintlike is a serious song with some comedic parts, I think it's about what he did and how he felt before he realized he wanted to be someone special TheBigDogYT: If Dead Friends is still the same album Jakey referenced 2 years ago in ""channel update and album preview"" and even some videos before that, then probably for 2, maybe 2 and a half years? It will probably feature the 4 or 5 tracks hes published since then, and then a bunch more. Also I think Saintlike was made in the same vane as Jakeys videos, the comedy helps carry along his overarching message or point. The point being in saintlike, at least to me, the struggle of being a small creator, in any sense, and the way it can bring you down or hinder your own creativity.

dvpmscw,NakeyJakey,OUR HOTTEST BOY IS ON THE FP AGAIN,"ObsidianJones: I've got the feeling the massive influx of fans will do to Jake what reddit did to h3h3.

Edit: that isn't good  Snortz69: AKA Wiener dude! CALEBthehun: What do you mean?

Asking out of ignorance not confrontation  ObsidianJones: I belong to a select few people who believe that h3h3 was more or less ruined by reddit and their blind fanaticism and cult mentality.

Not that being popular is the reason for their decline in quality, I think it's the speed. When you have humble people like Ethan and Hila, or Jakey for that matter, blowing up can do some serious damage. It can fuck with your humility, it can go to your head, it can make you hyper sensitive to your content and needs of your fans, and often time all of those things at once.

Jakey seems like a normal, humble, well adjusted person who wouldn't let these things go to his head, but it happens to nearly everyone. I remember when I thought h3h3s quality wouldn't wane, because of their down to earth attitude, but look at them now. In my opinion, I was an idiot to think that.  CALEBthehun: Thanks.  C9_Shiba: D O G B L E S S ABandApart: I feel like Jakey just wants to make dope shit for his fans no matter what, but what you said makes sense. Really hope he doesn‚Äôt fall into that trap. ObsidianJones: Yeah man, me too. At the end of the day no one is in charge of their fans. I think iDubbz gets away with his popularity by his blatant disregard for what his fans want. 

When one cares too much for their audience, it makes the transition into sellout unnoticeable, and very smooth, where the choice to sell out isn't even a decision made by Jakey, or H3, it's made by the exterior culture surrounding them.

What happens when Jakey's idea of what constitutes dope shit becomes what his fans want?

Examples of YouTubers who haven't let that happen are people like Dunkey or RedLetterMedia.",C9_Shiba,D O G B L E S S,0,Male,NakeyJakey,dvpmscw,840ww7,9,2,2.4849066497880004

However, the song and music video features three kids, none of whom are the naked Jacob. These kids can't be older than 6, (if you analyze the lyrics, at one point it sounds like the youngest one is saying ""I'm just a child yo I'm only six years old"" 8, and 10. However, Zakky, in 2012, 4 years prior, released a dance EP called Gospel Doesn't Work. 

What the fuck is going on? Is the Hot Boy himself affiliated with these three British boys?

dvoauf8,NakeyJakey,OUR HOTTEST BOY IS ON THE FP AGAIN,"ObsidianJones: I've got the feeling the massive influx of fans will do to Jake what reddit did to h3h3.

Edit: that isn't good  Snortz69: AKA Wiener dude! CALEBthehun: What do you mean?

Asking out of ignorance not confrontation  ObsidianJones: I belong to a select few people who believe that h3h3 was more or less ruined by reddit and their blind fanaticism and cult mentality.

Not that being popular is the reason for their decline in quality, I think it's the speed. When you have humble people like Ethan and Hila, or Jakey for that matter, blowing up can do some serious damage. It can fuck with your humility, it can go to your head, it can make you hyper sensitive to your content and needs of your fans, and often time all of those things at once.

Jakey seems like a normal, humble, well adjusted person who wouldn't let these things go to his head, but it happens to nearly everyone. I remember when I thought h3h3s quality wouldn't wane, because of their down to earth attitude, but look at them now. In my opinion, I was an idiot to think that.  CALEBthehun: Thanks.  C9_Shiba: D O G B L E S S ABandApart: I feel like Jakey just wants to make dope shit for his fans no matter what, but what you said makes sense. Really hope he doesn‚Äôt fall into that trap. ObsidianJones: Yeah man, me too. At the end of the day no one is in charge of their fans. I think iDubbz gets away with his popularity by his blatant disregard for what his fans want. 

When one cares too much for their audience, it makes the transition into sellout unnoticeable, and very smooth, where the choice to sell out isn't even a decision made by Jakey, or H3, it's made by the exterior culture surrounding them.

What happens when Jakey's idea of what constitutes dope shit becomes what his fans want?

Examples of YouTubers who haven't let that happen are people like Dunkey or RedLetterMedia.",CALEBthehun,Thanks. ,0,Male,NakeyJakey,dvoauf8,840ww7,9,1,2.3978952727983707

It was weird reading it because there's a ton of hate in the comment section!  People who thought the editing wasn't good, people who thought the jokes weren't funny, people who thought all number of hater things!

This was inspiring to me because, as we all know... Jakey is obviously a HotBoy!!

So no matter what your creative pursuit in life... the lesson that I gleaned from this, is that haters don't know shit!  They obviously can't tell a HotBoy when they see one, so don't let them get ya down!  and keep doin' what ya love.

dzu2ub4,NakeyJakey,(Remix/Edit) of Saintlike by NakeyJakey - Dogbless everyone,"Bighanno: What even is this? Cause it's not a remix by any stretch of the imagination O-A-B_rep: Remix (Slash) Edit,  (An edit of the song)       Bighanno: Yeah I get that but you didn't really do anything to the track so to call it a remix or even an edit is a bit disingenuous O-A-B_rep: we appreciate the opinion - Dog bless  get_grunk: The title made me feel sort of mislead when the video ended up being a book promotion. Because the video doesn‚Äôt really work as just a remix video. 
I like the costumes you guys have going, and the edit seemed interesting at first. Your group seems to have a pretty clear style which is good.

I've been wanting to listen to Jakey's songs without using youtube, but I want to pay for them and not download them through a converter because I personally believe that Jakey is one of us and we should support this Hot Boy because he is talented and deserves all the success he is due.

I searched for him on itunes a couple times, but I searched for 'Nakey Jakey"" and nothing would come up. It turns out that it's just under 'Jakey' which I found by searching 'Saintlike'. He has 3 songs I've seen and they are all technically listed under a different album each which makes his songs separated in my music app after I downloaded them. I am happy to make a playlist with his songs, but I feel like putting all 3 in one 'prototype' album would be more efficient for the average music consumer.

Jakey if you read these posts, please promote and link to your music so we can buy it properly!

7c6j5r,NakeyJakey,Concern for the Patreon,"baprahamian: TL;DR: I‚Äôm worried about donating to the patreon when Jakey is not sure what he wants to do with the channel and how to use the patreon to make it better. 

I am a current patron for Jakey and I am starting to wonder if I should continue to support him this way. If you‚Äôre reading this, please don‚Äôt take it the wrong way Jakey. I am I huge fan. I love all your content, including your videos, songs and even your fucking snapchats. The reason I am considering to stop supporting the patreon is because it seems like you don‚Äôt really have a direction for the channel. At least in past videos you‚Äôve stated the channel doesn‚Äôt really have a direction and it‚Äôs more of a side project to your music career/video career/game developer career?/whatever it is you end up doing. This on top of things like seeing you go to pax, buying a new camera, and just recently visiting New York makes me wonder if my money is actually going towards content on the channel. We get a video a week if we‚Äôre lucky and I feel that right now your channel doesn‚Äôt seem like an investment I should make.

dh03hrn,NakeyJakey,Games That Should Bang; U.S. Most Wanted: Nowhere to Hide and Spec Ops: The Line.,"NuclearCorpus: U.S. Most Wanted: Nowhere to Hide is about a retired U.S. Counter-Terrorist operative Randall Joyce goes rogue to hunt down criminals, terrorists, and warlords, uniquely as someone free from the laws his enemies don't adhere to‚Äîall while being supported unofficially by old friends in U.S. Intelligence and Special Operations.

The gameplay of U.S. Most Wanted can be described as a first-person shooter with tactical and simulation elements, these being reflected by the game's emphasis on custom mission load outs and high lethality of firearms.

The arsenal also includes tripwire claymores, silenced variants of several guns, various rocket and grenade launchers, as well as non-combat items like binoculars and almost entirely unimplemented lockpicks. In combat, any damage to the player can easily prove fatal, with light and heavy armor subsiding some damage, but reducing carrying capacity and not protecting against shots to the head.

However, U.S. Most Wanted is notable for its inconsistent and problematic gameplay, with extremely fast deaths, a lack of audible enemy movement, vague mission parameters, and AI that ranges between erratic and a constant ""charge and shoot"" pattern. These coincide with major, often unavoidable, irregularities left unfixed in the game and various other design or technical anomalies to be found.

In the game, the player controls Captain Martin Walker, who is sent into a post-catastrophe Dubai with an elite Delta Force team on a recon mission. As the game progresses, Walker's mental health deteriorates, as he begins to experience hallucinations and slowly realizes the horror of war. 

Spec Ops: The Line is one of those pleasant surprises that comes along every now and again, a video game story that really got to me, giving me genuine feelings of weariness, guilt, and actual physical sickness. 

Nothing good ever happens to anyone in Spec Ops: The Line. It starts with a rescue, a rough situation destined to get worse, and unravels in a downward spiral where only bad things happen to good people. By the end, physical, mental, and moral disruption leave each character in a very different place than they started.

Every firefight ends with Walker and his Delta Force squad regretting what they've done. The Line puts them in the precarious position of fighting their brethren. Rogue American soldiers who‚Äôve abandoned their duty in Dubai attack on sight, and not without reason. The city is a wasteland, the environment is as hostile as the refugees, and surviving requires aggressive self-defense. Dubai hosts a civil war between multiple factions trying not to die. The Deltas are just one of these groups.

Imagine a mixture of these games. Like a specialist police officer that is assassinating drug lords and gangsters, rapists and murderers. Yet, you see the horrifying pieces that fall into place when you do it. For example, without a drug lord; what happens to the people who got drugs off of them? You have a full-scale riot now downtown, thousands of addicts that breaking into pharmacies to take their drugs. In the same week, you have killed a major drug supplier and feel good about it, yet you know see what you have done with that. You are tear gassing violent addicts going through withdrawal.

Imagine a whole city that, as you attempt to clean it, you also destroy it at the same time. You see how it is going nowhere, how your job is meaningless.

8d6j5c,NakeyJakey,An idea for a video.,"sammyuelito: I figured this would be the best place to get this out there.

Recently a YouTube channel called GRsmash put out a video called ""Most iconic moments in melee history""

I know that NakeyJakey is a lover of melee and I would love to see a video put together by him over why each of these moments are iconic. 

To people who are uninitiated to melee, these clips may seem completely random, and having a video that is put together in NakeyJakeys awesome style could really give melee a boost. Maybe not something massive but still something.

Does anyone else think this is a good idea?
I realize most people who like NakeyJakey probably aren't melee fans (though I could be wrong) IleekSCox: Yeah a melee history lesson could be good, but anything by jakey is good, so... Formento: Yeah that would be awesome. 
A video called ""The Power of Super Smash Bros. Melee"" in which Jakey could explain why melee is such a great game and why hr loves it so much. He could also show some examples from the video you were talking about and maybe explaining how complex the game can be. All of that would not only be really entertaining, but also gratifying for the community!

Jakey please make it happen. 
We know that you love this game :)",sammyuelito,"I figured this would be the best place to get this out there.

dvnx9fh,NakeyJakey,OUR HOTTEST BOY IS ON THE FP AGAIN,"ObsidianJones: I've got the feeling the massive influx of fans will do to Jake what reddit did to h3h3.

Edit: that isn't good  Snortz69: AKA Wiener dude! CALEBthehun: What do you mean?

Asking out of ignorance not confrontation  ObsidianJones: I belong to a select few people who believe that h3h3 was more or less ruined by reddit and their blind fanaticism and cult mentality.

Not that being popular is the reason for their decline in quality, I think it's the speed. When you have humble people like Ethan and Hila, or Jakey for that matter, blowing up can do some serious damage. It can fuck with your humility, it can go to your head, it can make you hyper sensitive to your content and needs of your fans, and often time all of those things at once.

Jakey seems like a normal, humble, well adjusted person who wouldn't let these things go to his head, but it happens to nearly everyone. I remember when I thought h3h3s quality wouldn't wane, because of their down to earth attitude, but look at them now. In my opinion, I was an idiot to think that.  CALEBthehun: Thanks.  C9_Shiba: D O G B L E S S ABandApart: I feel like Jakey just wants to make dope shit for his fans no matter what, but what you said makes sense. Really hope he doesn‚Äôt fall into that trap. ObsidianJones: Yeah man, me too. At the end of the day no one is in charge of their fans. I think iDubbz gets away with his popularity by his blatant disregard for what his fans want. 

When one cares too much for their audience, it makes the transition into sellout unnoticeable, and very smooth, where the choice to sell out isn't even a decision made by Jakey, or H3, it's made by the exterior culture surrounding them.

What happens when Jakey's idea of what constitutes dope shit becomes what his fans want?

Is there any other artists that sound like him? Thanks. Astronian: It's not the same style of hip hop but yung gravy sounds just like Jakey.  123coolmania: Brockhampton can sound similar sometimes. Check out JUNKY or SWAMP, they sound most like some of Jakey's more angry stuff ItsMattDog: If you look at his sound cloud he has a bunch of people he has reposted. They sound similar to his style. baprahamian: If you‚Äôre looking for a mainstream artist, tyler the creators new album flower boy was excellent and I‚Äôm sure Jakey has taken some inspiration from him MisterG1415: Uh they arnt like jakey but you should definetly listen to Frank Ocean and Kanye West Kidistipe: Dan bull is a ""Nerd rapper"" who is a pretty solid pick. He does a lot of vidya game music, but some of his songs are on fire *Older raps: Borderlands, Assassins creed, skyrim*.  LeimBR: I love Brockhampton! STAR (and even BUMP I think) might sound like Jakey aswell.  LeimBR: I loved Flower Boy! I think he did, too PipePanicFTW: Who dat **hot boy?** Who him is? PipePanicFTW: I think that one of Jakey's inspirations is DJ Shadow, and I think that he stated at one point that Endtroducing was one of his favorite albums. I definitely recommend the song Nobody Speak.   Noided_Driver: Trial of the Golden Witch (Digibro)

e4y5sso,Pokimane,Pokimane reacts to the ksi vs logan paul fight result,"ProdigyGamer75: No offence to poki but she really needs to learn what she's talking about before she talks BagelsAndJewce: Very unpopular opinion there but I kinda agree. 

The rematch was already in the contract so tying wasn't going to guarantee anything for a second match, both of them were utterly confused with the result each thinking they were going to win and both kind of frustrated with it. So they either became great actors while exhausted or that was totally unexpected. And they weren't going to bleed with head gear on unless one of them took a shot to the nose directly.

 And from my understanding and scoring of it Logan won early KSI won late for a 3-3 tie. Had it been seven rounds there'd be a winner but clearly they wanted that to be in play to some degree both knowing that if they fought for seven rounds exhaustion would defeat the loser more than the other fighter.  splrltz: why are u talking about staged u stupid fuck when you fake your reactions.. there is a video of you legit insta locking draven to troll tyler1 and pretend to act as if u didn't know wat u was doin Carltxn: Finally a fucking good answer on Reddit, holy shit, this was hard to find. Just hate everyone saying the rigged and shit, knowing 0 about boxing and not knowing that they had a rematch in their contracts. 
Just think for a second: would you train as hard for then having a rigged fight? They‚Äôll earn millions anyway, they don‚Äôt care about that shit at the end of the day ffs. BagelsAndJewce: People are viewing it as a rigged spectacle because that‚Äôs all they can comprehend. KSI and Logan don‚Äôt like each other aside from the rematch being pre planned they both want to not only win but beat the shit out of each other. Just look at eithers channels they‚Äôre abrasive and don‚Äôt gain anything from the tie. They wanted to win and I think the rematch will be super interesting. I‚Äôll probably pay for that one cause they definitely put a show on worth paying.

7bvcni,Pokimane,Anyone know what happened? D:,"Derrick1522: https://twitter.com/pokimanelol/status/928684746409885696 Zari0x: Quite a story

-she went out for food 
-ate a lot
-ate a tiny bit of something she normally never orders but gave it a shot anyway
-she didn't feel good at all and called an Uber to picker her up (10 minute home ride)
-when they took the last turn to drive on the street where she lives, her stomach couldn't handle it anymore and she puked in het Ubers car. She really didn't want to puke in the Ubers car so she vomitted on the little bag she had with her. 
- she felt so bad and asked for stuff to clean everything up
*paper tissue
*paper tissue with water
*paper tissue with rubbing alcohol
(3 ways she cleaned the car)
- when the uber dropped her off she gave him a 200% tip + the amount she had to pay for the ride.

Story continues with projectile vommiting in the house, being exhausted by the fact that her body turned against her.

Next day she wakes up to find a message where the uber driver charges her 80 dollars because she puked in his car. 
Later in the story she said she understood why the driver did it (because it is hard to clean the seats to get rid of the smell) but was still salty that she gave the tip.

TLDR: ate food her stomach couldn't handle / vomitted in ubers car / cleaned everything / tipped him a generous amount / wakes up next day to an 80 dollar charge to cover the costs to clean the car Derrick1522: Thank you for the story.",Derrick1522,https://twitter.com/pokimanelol/status/928684746409885696,0,Female,Pokimane,7bvcni,7bvcni,3,3,1.9459101490553132

e4hxj3x,Pokimane,Pokimane isn't treated correctly,"theflightlessbear: Freedom of speech. ( it is mostly just memes bro) oHistoric: She's thic AF, top 10 hottest Fortnite streamer.  DiamondDM13: Putting aside how funny it all is, how hopeful some people are on one side and how disgusting others are, on the other side, it is all up to Imane to take action.

If she doesn't like any of the actions people are taking, she is the one that has to take action against it. She has most tools, she can block people or voice chat in games, she can decide who she allows to speak in her channel, be it with voice or text. She can ban people in chat or blacklist words she doesn't want, she can even instruct her Moderation team to take the actions she desires.

I don't watch the stream so I don't know if she perpetuates these actions, but if it is bothering her, she has to take action against it. And if it bothers you, as a viewer, you can voice your concerns to her, or you can decide not to view her channel.

Personally, I would advise you to go to Youtube instead, and check the OfflineTV channel. That kind of behavior is not present in those videos, and the videos are very enjoyable to watch. Whoknvws: If this were 2009 she would have heard a lot worse things from that 12 year old..  nartics: Jesus, you are such a white knight. 

Although the kid probably shouldn't have said that live on stream, he lives in a free country, and has every right to say whatever he wants to say. People who believe that 12 year olds act different nowadays, than they did 50 years ago are wrong. 12 year olds, and teens as a whole have always been immature and making dick jokes and being edgy. 90s/80s/70s kids haven't noticed this because they frankly didn't talk to children very much before the internet. Let alone without anonymity.

 Purevoyager007: Nice opinion. It‚Äôs wrong but your opinion  feministdunce: In my opinion, twitch girls are worse than camwhores. At least a camwhore is honest about what she's selling. Pokimane is selling her 'company' to lonely incels who donate because they think in some world they got a shot with her. hav0cbl00d: i agree he's pretty swell bomli77: Kid was on game voice chat, is that really public speaking only because other party decides to stream it?

thanks ninja (; Sparkz17: Iv‚Äôe never been so happy in my life  Sparkz17: If you didn't know, recently a 12 year old got in a duo with Pokimane, starting off saying ""Pokimane is hot"" all the way over to ""I beat my meat to you"" and ""My ball hairs are sweating i'm texting all my friends."" Not only does this kid harass her, but then he goes to say that ""black people can run faster."" MAY I REMIND YOU THAT THIS KID IS 12. Saying these kind of things on stream is one embarrassing and awkward to Pokimane in front of hundreds of viewers and two just not ok. This hasn't been the only time this has happened to her. She has been repeatedly been called ""thicc"" on her Twitch chat, other social medias, and on Reddit too. Last time I checked, she is a Twitch gamer, not a porn star. So can we please stop commenting on her body?  Sparkz17: Is that really how her streams are? Iv‚Äôe never even watched TheBluePundit: Was what he said rude? Yes. Could she have just muted him and/or left the game? Also yes. If she doesn't care enough to leave the game then I don't see why everyone is so bothered. MyLifeBeLikeOooAaa: You are such a white knight, sorry dude  Shinodacs: i toss my salad to donations. MxFragz: &gt; but then he goes to say that ""black people can run faster.""

dv6s6r8,Pokimane,Where is old Pokimane?,"kierakei: I used to love to watch Pokimane's streams. She interacted with chat, genuinely seemed to love playing lol and generally everyone had good time.

Nowadays it feels that poki has been replaced with heartless plastic doll whose only goal is money and viewers are just numbers to sell to highest bidder. Her twitter is just ads or retweets of brands and devoid of any personal content. Instagram is same but more lowkey pushing of various clothing brands.

Her streams are short and without any schedule. Main content of streams is now IRL and mostly kardashian esque shopping ones to show off wealth. When playing lol she seems to be far away and forced to play game she now hates. If there is interaction its only for donations.

Recently there was even a low point where whole stream was infomercial for noodles! What's next; poker stream with &lt;insert brand&gt; vodka as sponsor?

I'm not purist where you have to be starving artist to be 'real' but its near the point where sponsors(ads) are not to support content but  they ARE the content. I mean its fine to play awful mobile games for money time to time or have most of gaming equipment sponsored. But if your main audience is companies and not the people who pay you by subs/buying merch then what is the point actually to sub?

In short; someone bring old Poki back. :(
 maartenxq: The world changes so do people. She stayed as happy as she always was, which is probably the most important. Xourr: I think she‚Äôs strayed away from her community a bit, although I think you‚Äôre exaggerating. It‚Äôs difficult for streamers to maintain a personal connection with their viewers with a viewership as large as hers. It‚Äôs the same with summit, for instance. Amazing guy, great streams, but chat is moving so fast and there‚Äôs so many donations and subs that it‚Äôs impossible for him to maintain connection with his viewers. At the end of the day, this is still her job, it‚Äôs how she earns a living and she has to look out for herself first. Perhaps she‚Äôs starting to go a little overboard, perhaps OfflineTV is pushing her into this style. Who knows.  Kobdzio: While I kinda understand your problem with ads I can't agree with the only for money/donations reactions :/ let's be real here. The amout of growth poki's experienced over the past few months is insane. Chat moves at lightning speed and it's almost impossible to read everything. That's how it works. Your creator's get the success you've probably always wanted them to have but they are not gonna pay attention to everyone. I personally love IRL streams and I tune in everytime ^_^ I even prefer them over League content LUL.
 Boopdoop27: Yea I agree. I use to love her streams when she was like 1k-2k viewers, now I hardly watch at all because I just don't enjoy it anymore. I'm happy for her with how much she has grown, and clearly a lot of other people like her new style, I just personally don't. And I don't think she will be going back anytime soon =( Boopdoop27: Summit hardly does sellout streams though. Plus he uses sub mode a lot which would probably help with what op is talking about. But that's up to poki and how she wants to see her chat Xourr: The difference here being summit is big enough that he doesn‚Äôt need to go into sellout mode. He is way past the point of counting subs and donations. Poki‚Äôs donations, subs, and viewership are not nearly big enough for that. Alternatively, poki has reached the viewership count to where it‚Äôs nearly impossible to establish meaningful connections with her viewers.  Boopdoop27: &gt;The difference here being summit is big enough that he doesn‚Äôt need to go into sellout mode. 

So what poki isnt? That's just not true at all. She might not be loosing track of subs and donations like him, but she definitely makes an insane amount from them alone. I think it's a bit of a stretch to say she needs to go into sellout mode. I understand her not interacting with viewers as much though. Especially with how big she has gotten, that's fine, and should honestly be expected. I just mentioned sub mode because it seems like a good way to get some interaction in when you grow to a certain point Xourr: You are either vastly underestimating how much money summit makes or vastly overestimating how much money poki makes. Obviously she doesn‚Äôt need sellout mode to live comfortably. But why live comfortably when you can do so much more? Boopdoop27: I don't think they are comparable amounts, they're not. And she is already living more than comfortably I'd bet, but that's not the point. She can keep doing sellout streams and reaction clips for the youtubers if she want to keep making more money, it's her stream after all. But I don't think it's wrong for me to say I don't enjoy that type of content just because I use to like her streams  Xourr: No one said you were wrong for disliking that type of content.  Boopdoop27: Great, then we are on the same page.  SoulStealerThresh: I like noodles. MarvelousMaverickk: TBH, I don't watch her stream anymore. The problem as anyone knows is that when a streamer has over 10K viewers like she has it becomes difficult for her to connect with her subs and followers. I wish her all the success in the world but she will have to figure it out on how to deal with all of her success because when you lose the connection you have with your subs and followers I would think for her it starts to lose meaning, unless of course all she cares about is the money, and of course that is up to her.

 chose the option non-digestion

e0rbso7,Pokimane,Feedback from last Poki podcast w/ Destiny,"angelotadeucci: 1¬∫ I was hearing white noise at the beginning of the stream, IDK if this is proposital. After people started talking more, it became imperceptible.

2¬∫ If you guys want to relax on chair do it but bring the mic closer. I'm pretty sure moving the mic doesn't produce any sound that should be bad to the quality. And you don't need to talk louder, just bring the mic closer.

3¬∫ Since you guys are sitting in a straight table with everyone looking to their sides to look at each other, sometimes stereo audio seems a bit weird and lower the volume. At some point more audio was coming from the right then the left. I saw someone at chat complain about that too. Maybe force the mics to be mono, but I don't know if this affects quality.

4¬∫ Also, if it was possible to people look at each other from the other side of the table, just like h3h3 podcast is, it would be AWESOME. And also fix 3¬∫.

5¬∫ Not using fixed topics, or trying to stick to the topic, was cool to the conversations be more cool and the flow was good too, but sometimes it divert too much. Even though I enjoy the story behind twitch and yours careers, maybe more topics outside twitch would be cool.

Just my 2 cents, this podcast was awesome and I expect more awesomeness. thanks for reading 

~~Sorry for the poor english D:~~ LuKSTaR: My constructive criticism goes to Fed and Poki which is to try to limit the use of saying 'like' too frequently. Its fine to use as a filler word every so often but I feel especially with Fed its way too excessive to the point of it being distracting. Being able to speak more concise goes a long way to keeping your audience engaged, even if you have to pause before you can continue!

But overall I really enjoyed the podcast

OMEGALUL Kieraran: [X] Doubt BlueKokiri: I honestly think it's a meme at this point, I personally think that Fed will stay friendzoned lol. But who knows? I could be wrong. theblacksmithz: Yeah honestly calling someone babe is textbook friend zone. Like you wouldn‚Äôt call your head over heels crush babes, cuz that‚Äôd be weird. You would with a close friend you‚Äôre comfortable with though. Jason2469: You honestly think they looked over each other when they first met??? People who date call each other babe. You probs haven‚Äôt been in a relationship. It‚Äôs a common word used often. Either way. Fed saying babe is kind of a reach lol if someone wants to say that that means they‚Äôre dating  theblacksmithz: No I think they‚Äôre both into each other, and I think it‚Äôs likely they‚Äôll be together in the end, but for now they‚Äôre just friends. I think you‚Äôre making the mistake of assuming ‚Äòbabes‚Äô can only be used to refer to a significant other with, when really I refer to my platonic friends as babes sometimes, and cuz we‚Äôre just friends, they know it‚Äôs a joke. Btw, I have been in a relationship, and even if I hadn‚Äôt I, along with literally everyone ever, would know that couples call each other babes, but it‚Äôs not exclusive to this context. Jason2469: You said ‚Äútextbook friend zone‚Äù when someone calls someone else ‚Äúbabe‚Äù. You were implying that someone doesn‚Äôt call their crush babe, or someone they‚Äôre ‚Äúhead over heels‚Äù for. And I‚Äôm saying. People who are in relationships and are used to each other, will call each other babe as if calling them by their actual name. Saying babe is hella casual in a relationship.

dudr3dl,Pokimane,Ideas for youtube channel,"kissanime29: Always wondered how come you do not post random quick videos on your youtube. I know you do highlight videos regularly which is awesome as sometimes people miss your streams and such. You have the occasional vlog. What about simple Q and A's every month or something or a challenge every now and then. Could react to your old videos or do make up tutorials. I am sure you have thought about all of this before, I am just curious why. 

I think a lot of people would love to see more youtube videos from you, especially with how big your YT has gotten. They can be simple too but just an added video every week or two would be awesome. 

Maybe there has already been discussions on this before and I just haven't looked. If you read this, thanks for your time.

dt1udum,Pokimane,Hey guys how did you guys find out about poki,"alaraidk67: Here's  my story. I'm a new sub to poki. I started to watch her streams and asmr video about 1 month ago. So  I was looking for some asmr videos and at first i was only watching gibi but I decided look for new ones to watch. Not going to lie I was looking for a cute girl to watch and saw video of poki. At first I thought she was just an asmr YouTuber but one day I got bored and decided to stalk her. Don't judge me every one does it. I saw that she had a twitch and posted her streams on YouTube. I'm not a big lol fan but I liked her personality so I watch her streams now and then. Maybe one day I'll give lol a chance. How did you find out about her hirio03: Thanks to T Dragon... I mean, Toast,when he joined OfflineTV. Now I'm here to stay  HavocalTTV: I watched Scarra and saw her on one of his streams, learned more about the house, followed all of them since. pokimane: üò≠‚ù§Ô∏è i love this thread/idea, i like hearing how everyone found me! SternMorge: Some random Twitch compilation on Youtube(autoplay). She is quite enjoyable to watch/have on in the background. Alpha_mau5: I first saw her on BeyondTheRift so I started watching her streams. Then I met her at LCS and she was really nice so I've been subbed ever since. üòÅ G_Teez: Browsing league streams 4 years ago FeelsGoodMan   Odtsdog: The memes brought me here  CryptoJim66: Kinda ridiculous but I was in the same math class as her at Uni. One of my friends pointed her out and told me she was really good at league or something. Saw her on twitch a few times since and recently started keeping up with the offline TV stuff. 

Throwback to second year eng Nicochii: I found her through Lily when she joined the offline tv house. I basically went from just watching Lily to watching basically everyone in the house. Saw Poki and she is a bundle of fun so I'm glad I found her channel g14ntd0rk24: Came across Poki when she had like 200-500 viewers on average. Came for the French/Eng and D3 gameplay. One of the few vocal streamers that weren't screaming into their mic. Also helps that Poki is blessed by the gene pool. loutt96: On some random LCS documentary video in like season 4 or 5. I recently tried finding it again and I couldn't. I think it was a C9 documentary series. wamsword: I was doing some (very) light stalking of Lily to see if that really is her real voice (still no idea tbh) and I enjoyed their duo vids Supekki: Just randomly was searching through League section on twitch about a year ago and wanted to watch someone who was playing mid, so i found poki. When she still did EU friendly streams monkaS nano_17: A family member told me about her like 2 years back I think dynamo_light: She was on Beyond the rift with QT/Scarra sometime last year, she seemed pretty chill so started following her content ever since :) NightBleue3: DOMINGO !! Un3arth1yGalaxy4: TBH I don't even remember. I think I was browsing League streamers and I saw Poki was live. I didnt follow much streamers, at that point I pretty much only liked Scarra and Doublelift, so Poki was the new addition to fav streamers. I checked on some site and I started following on October 12th 2015 eilitist: I kept seeing her on YouTube click bait went and found her liked what I saw and subbed  RyuCaster: YouTube recommended me one of her ASMR videos Jcrane117: I found her randomly years ago right before she went to Africa and got pregnant  Kobdzio: &gt; blessed by the gene pool.
Couldn't have said that better lol
 itsRepkoto: back in 2014... those where the days 
 vapor47: Friend linked a video where toasts sister comes to the house and embarrasses him, then I saw poki, then I was like damn.
Plus she has some French stuff, which I'm trying to learn so that might help Striimu: Your vid just popped on my front page in yt and now i watch mostly just OfflineTV. I'm kinda hooked now. HSinvictus: I'm quite a newcomer here but I actually found poki from reckful's bike ride with her.

e4y6hj8,Pokimane,Pokimane reacts to the ksi vs logan paul fight result,"ProdigyGamer75: No offence to poki but she really needs to learn what she's talking about before she talks BagelsAndJewce: Very unpopular opinion there but I kinda agree. 

The rematch was already in the contract so tying wasn't going to guarantee anything for a second match, both of them were utterly confused with the result each thinking they were going to win and both kind of frustrated with it. So they either became great actors while exhausted or that was totally unexpected. And they weren't going to bleed with head gear on unless one of them took a shot to the nose directly.

 And from my understanding and scoring of it Logan won early KSI won late for a 3-3 tie. Had it been seven rounds there'd be a winner but clearly they wanted that to be in play to some degree both knowing that if they fought for seven rounds exhaustion would defeat the loser more than the other fighter.  splrltz: why are u talking about staged u stupid fuck when you fake your reactions.. there is a video of you legit insta locking draven to troll tyler1 and pretend to act as if u didn't know wat u was doin Carltxn: Finally a fucking good answer on Reddit, holy shit, this was hard to find. Just hate everyone saying the rigged and shit, knowing 0 about boxing and not knowing that they had a rematch in their contracts. 
Just think for a second: would you train as hard for then having a rigged fight? They‚Äôll earn millions anyway, they don‚Äôt care about that shit at the end of the day ffs. BagelsAndJewce: People are viewing it as a rigged spectacle because that‚Äôs all they can comprehend. KSI and Logan don‚Äôt like each other aside from the rematch being pre planned they both want to not only win but beat the shit out of each other. Just look at eithers channels they‚Äôre abrasive and don‚Äôt gain anything from the tie. They wanted to win and I think the rematch will be super interesting. I‚Äôll probably pay for that one cause they definitely put a show on worth paying.

 Quasaru: What are your goals this year for life, gaming, ASMR? 

Have you received the new ASMR mic yet? 

Gibi and you are probably my favorite ASMRists and I miss the uploads! I was watching her stream when you joined her channel. You guys said you might teach her how to play League and she teaches you Overwatch is that still a possibility in the future?

Do you have any plans to go to PAX West this year? Oviix: Will you be uploading more variety content to your channel ?  ant_crusher: &gt; When are you gon' pay my nibba Alex

Nibba be grinding hardcore TeepEU: fr alex revitalised the discord server :&gt; Samuramaster: Alex our nibba head mod needs his pay, fixed the discord issues double his bonus thanks
 TeepEU: 2*0=0 

^&gt;:c LaFreaky: Will there be any no makeup stream anytime in future? I and probably others too, wants to see more of your natural beauty. Samuramaster: you're deputy mod so you get double aswell 
 Pluxxxy: nice troll... we are all equal mods  RSm8: The offlineTV streams are really good, you should do more of those! (House games/Shopping/etc) Madiii7: Will you visit the Gamescom in germany anytime soon  ?? :)&lt;3 Kobdzio: In the life of a famous streamer how do you deal with getting to know other people and, moreover ""letting"" them into your life? 

I personally think that it must be hard to trust anyone and to know who is truly your friend or even someone closer than that. 

 Piniataq: Just wanted you to know that I love your content and I hope you never stop uploading. &lt;3 Odtsdog: haHAA That-boi-lioparty: Where does Pokimane comes from ? You just added random shit before Imane ? Or is it your secret love to Poke ? Giraffies: Perhaps [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLO_WnRQMNk) video will answer your question. Dalton_Kain: any plans on having toast teach you hearthstone?  HavocalTTV: If you could change one thing you did in the past, what would it be? GIVE_ME_UR_FOODZ: What do you look for in your future husband?

Are you more likely to date someone who plays league, or a chad like myself who doesn't vidya?

Why are you so cute when you get tilted?

Will you do more content with you dancing? Dancing is awesome tbh. When you and the crew were learning K-Pop last week was pretty fun.

How many 2 year olds do you think you could fight at once in hand-to-hand combat?

Do you have any guilty pleasures that you keep on the down-low? Shaaaaaaare plz.

What were you doing on Friday, November 22nd, 2014 at 6:02 PM GMT?

What is your favorite wild animal (non-domesticated)?

Where are some places you'd like to travel?

Do you ever peek in on newbie streamers? (say yes so people get a small ego boost n stuff)

What's your proudest moment as a streamer?

How do you feel about the acquisition of power via social media and gaming? Do you feel your sphere of influence growing or waning in the next quarter?

When would you like to arrange a date? Giraffies: You have a bunch of good questions here, but since many of them are questions about her personal life, keep in mind she may not answer those personal questions or even answer them at all.

I'll have more later. hubertjestemkrul: Are you for or against JD? senusin: hi mom SternMorge: I heard you like Zelda and Pokemon a lot, will you be streaming any other games, for example these, in supplement to league in the future? avix213: Will you ever play pubg? epicnerd2015: Will you be going to PAX East this year?

This year I want to focus more on my health, and pursue something new content-wise (not 100% sure what). Dotabrodies: Will you ever make your bed? Oviix: Another question, when will your new merch that you talked about on stream be coming available ? 
 yousef-171: Can you speak Arabic? if you can how good are you
 imherefornow9x: Bro, she's Moroccan but grow up in Canada. She said in numerous times that she speaks Darija (aka Moroccan/Algerian version of Arabic) - but doesn't speak standard Arabic which means she can understand Moroccans/Algerians but can't understand regular Arabic from say Egypt etc. nor can they understand her. Source: am Moroccan. pokimane: :( this is unfortunately something I‚Äôm still trying to figure out.. I‚Äôm a very friendly and bubbly person, but rarely do I fully let people in and that‚Äôs something I only recently realized T_T I‚Äôll keep u guys updated lol.. pokimane: aaaah yes I‚Äôve been wanting to do this for so long :( Kobdzio: Tbh I kinda knew that already :x and your last stream only assured me :p

I remember when you had some bad days in the past because you didn't know if you're going about your life the way you should. It's funny how just by watching someone you can relate so much.

One last piece of advice :d

Do you really think that embracing the culture of friendzone helps you? XD don't get me wrong I'm not trying to be mean but Friendzone doesn't exist. 
Take a minute of your life (a literal minute lol) to watch Jacksfilms explain it perfectly at 3:37 --&gt; 

https://youtu.be/z1huAFcy3ww

I enjoy everything you put out but that ""friendzone culture"" bothers me constantly xd
 LaFreaky: Hope i will not miss it live because of time difference. This_Storys_Hero: Feals bad man when you live in Europe and Pokemane's stream starts at like 2 or 3 AM... So you tune in to watch the stream when it's finished, but you can only wach the stream highlights because there is no stream... feals realy bad man üò¢ MarvelousMaverickk: Poki, I have noticed that streamers can make mistakes and subs can make mistakes with respect to their behavior when e-mailing each other, tweeting,  and speaking in the chat, but a streamer can ban them from the stream. Can you forgive someone for their behavior and have them back? People do, after all, make mistakes, and I'm sure you're not perfect as well. pokimane: when he‚Äôs back ya :D LaFreaky: Early streams like yesterday's are like blessing to us europeans. I feel ya mate. Dalton_Kain: Awesome thanks &lt;3  TeepEU: I think the friendzone stuff is mostly just a jokey way of letting down guys easy who become a lil' bit too attached. Kobdzio: Well, I understand what you are saying but that's the case. Embracing the culture - which means even mentioning it. If you say something jokingly but it happens all the time it becomes accepted. 
Her discord is called PokiSquad/Friendzone squad (or something similar) you see what I mean? :p 
It got to the point where ""friendzone"" is a part of this community and I personally think it shouldn't be the case ^ ^ TeepEU: I don't think there's anything wrong with the idea of the friend-zone, it just means guys who want something more but the feeling isn't mutually returned, what's the issue? Kobdzio: The issue is deeply rooted in today's society. I encourage you to watch the video that I mentioned in my initial comment. Thanks! TeepEU: I did, all Jack says is that the friend-zone should be an indication to move on from the person who friend-zoned you. Which is the same way that Poki uses it? Kobdzio: Yes, but he air quotes the phrase ""friendzone"" because it's ridiculous. It rejects the idea of a friendship with an opposite gender. I don't see it as a funny thing to say :/ for me it just shows how men are portrayed by society. Maybe it's just my problem but a lot of people don't even understand the problem with ""friendzone"" xd and I've seen plenty of discussions on the internet. You can dive into the topic yourself. TeepEU: friendzone doesn't deny the idea of a friendship with the opposite gender, it's specifically for when one of two parties would want to date, whereas the other just wants to be friends. Kobdzio: I dont think I'm qualified enough to convince you that the problem with the friendzone is more than just a silly relationship with a  girl that doesn't feel the same way xd as I said before there are a lot of discussions on the internet on the topic.

7y52vd,Pokimane,Ideas for youtube channel,"kissanime29: Always wondered how come you do not post random quick videos on your youtube. I know you do highlight videos regularly which is awesome as sometimes people miss your streams and such. You have the occasional vlog. What about simple Q and A's every month or something or a challenge every now and then. Could react to your old videos or do make up tutorials. I am sure you have thought about all of this before, I am just curious why. 

I think a lot of people would love to see more youtube videos from you, especially with how big your YT has gotten. They can be simple too but just an added video every week or two would be awesome. 

Maybe there has already been discussions on this before and I just haven't looked. If you read this, thanks for your time.

e4hxkkq,Pokimane,Pokimane isn't treated correctly,"theflightlessbear: Freedom of speech. ( it is mostly just memes bro) oHistoric: She's thic AF, top 10 hottest Fortnite streamer.  DiamondDM13: Putting aside how funny it all is, how hopeful some people are on one side and how disgusting others are, on the other side, it is all up to Imane to take action.

If she doesn't like any of the actions people are taking, she is the one that has to take action against it. She has most tools, she can block people or voice chat in games, she can decide who she allows to speak in her channel, be it with voice or text. She can ban people in chat or blacklist words she doesn't want, she can even instruct her Moderation team to take the actions she desires.

I don't watch the stream so I don't know if she perpetuates these actions, but if it is bothering her, she has to take action against it. And if it bothers you, as a viewer, you can voice your concerns to her, or you can decide not to view her channel.

Personally, I would advise you to go to Youtube instead, and check the OfflineTV channel. That kind of behavior is not present in those videos, and the videos are very enjoyable to watch. Whoknvws: If this were 2009 she would have heard a lot worse things from that 12 year old..  nartics: Jesus, you are such a white knight. 

Although the kid probably shouldn't have said that live on stream, he lives in a free country, and has every right to say whatever he wants to say. People who believe that 12 year olds act different nowadays, than they did 50 years ago are wrong. 12 year olds, and teens as a whole have always been immature and making dick jokes and being edgy. 90s/80s/70s kids haven't noticed this because they frankly didn't talk to children very much before the internet. Let alone without anonymity.

All her 35 year old white knight fans were telling her to leave, and she clearly saw it, yet stayed... wonder why? *cough easy content cough* LordSnoh: That's gonna be a yikes from me. RazorBackFan15: Even Tfue said she was getting easy content from it TheTurtler31: Dude obviously spent less time in Bio than the 12 year old did #FastTwitchFibersAreOP ResolverOshawott: ""Twitch girl gamer"" and ""Cam girl"" are very very intertwined nowadays.  SlothHawkOfficial: She's not gonna sleep with you. Nitraus: You don't know the kid is 12. He sounds older.

Also, she is thicc, get the fuck over it it's objectively true. ACViperPro: If you didn't know, recently a 12 year old got in a duo with Pokimane, starting off saying ""Pokimane is hot"" all the way over to ""I beat my meat to you"" and ""My ball hairs are sweating i'm texting all my friends."" Not only does this kid harass her, but then he goes to say that ""black people can run faster."" MAY I REMIND YOU THAT THIS KID IS 12. Saying these kind of things on stream is one embarrassing and awkward to Pokimane in front of hundreds of viewers and two just not ok. This hasn't been the only time this has happened to her. She has been repeatedly been called ""thicc"" on her Twitch chat, other social medias, and on Reddit too. Last time I checked, she is a Twitch gamer, not a porn star. So can we please stop commenting on her body? Redsqa: This is a grown woman who can take her own decisions. If she didnt want to listen to him anymore, she could have just quit or muted him. I think you'd be better off finding an actual pornstar and squeeze your hog to her, than try and whiteknight for an e-girl on twitch like a thirsty teenager. jumpm1n: That 12 year old has more game than you Fedoratipper420. KGDrayken: If it really was an issue she would've left the game or muted him, but she didn't because the kid's a legend and it was easy content. I'd be ready to bet a lot of money on the fact that you were straight up fuming when the kid mentionned Myth as Pokimane's partner. I wonder how much money you donated to Pokimane trying to get laid. :thinking: Firestorm7i: That and its fucking hilarious.

 Houeclipse: Its work doesn't it?  nighght: As a side note ""I can say what I want it's a free country"" is about the weakest most pointless argument someone can add to their cause (whatever it is). Everything else you said is fine but stop saying that if you want people to take you seriously in real life. Sharplr: She fed the troll. Poki could've handled this better. If she was so disgusted by this then why didn't she mute or kick him? The kid is a kid for fuck's sake.  spahghetti: I got offended just listening to what i thought a 12 year old in 2009 would have said.  it was actually scary. xTroopa: It is completely relevent, because in places where you can't say such things there are potentially severe consquences. WarmScar: You forgot Nick eh 30 :rage: I would give everything to slap his ass once WarmScar: She does. I once donated 3 dollars and she said thank you rubbertubing: yeah he's a pretty swell guy imo tbh gabzpianoxin: Also don't forget, it's more entertaining hanging out with 12 yo Chad, than 35 yo virgins. WarmScar: She will one day. I donated 3 dollars once and she said thank you WarmScar: She will one day. I donated 3 dollars once and she said thank you lmpervious: &gt;i am not like the other ~~guys~~ 12 year olds üò§ hristok00: You're so pathetic dude. How much of a whiteknight can you be? Piss off. FlaccidOstrich: Lmao you're right. Freedom of speech is totally irrelevant when defending saying whatever you want.  _DarthJawa_: No, Poki is not gonna date you just because you stood up for her, nor will she even notice you. Get outta here white knight FlaccidOstrich: Didn't you know that male streamers can't be objectified or go through bullying online?!  flipdipslip: holy fuckin cringe LOL LamBelo: this is so stupid, first she is an adult and should know how to handle the situation, secounds she invited him and couldve kicked him just as fast, and lastly no people will comment on her body because people do, and they are 99% saying compliments so why does it matter
 Purevoyager007: Nice opinion. It‚Äôs wrong but your opinion  feministdunce: In my opinion, twitch girls are worse than camwhores. At least a camwhore is honest about what she's selling. Pokimane is selling her 'company' to lonely incels who donate because they think in some world they got a shot with her. hav0cbl00d: i agree he's pretty swell bomli77: Kid was on game voice chat, is that really public speaking only because other party decides to stream it? Sparkz17: OMEGALUL

MyLifeBeLikeOooAaa: You are such a white knight, sorry dude  Shinodacs: i toss my salad to donations. MxFragz: &gt; but then he goes to say that ""black people can run faster.""

Are there any plans to be more EU friendly?  Quasaru: Do you plan on playing VRChat or some other variety game soon I like the VRChat streams they are unique. Also it'd be cool to see you more active on your own discord and the OfflineTV one if possible! I think it would be funny if you submitted art in Lily's art class whenever her next one is!

I ask you this because it let's us know you better as a person. I personally look for 1. High level of Self-esteem 2. High level of self-confidence 3. Highly Intelligent 4. VERY Romantic 5. Has a good sense of humor 6. Has a Big Heart. 7. Loves long passionate kissing. Well that is my list. How about yours. By the way, I'm just asking you this to just get more of an insight into your personality, that's all. We would love to hear it. Thanks Poki, I appreciate it. MurlocMan007: Do you like elephants?

Double Edit: Does defending the whore get you off? Is it the closest you get to female approval? 5h1tface: ""you guys"" like help me out everyone, he totally left me hanging I mean geez, wtf, help me everyone, be on MY side. JoeHardesty: Is twitch just Omegle now with a couple guys playing games? 

Why don't they just institute a no cleavage rule or something. I'm all about tits, and I'm all about gaming, but Twitch is supposed to be a community for the common interest of gaming. There are already plenty of outlets sl00ts like them can use to con guys out of money [Which is insane you would pay for anything even closely resembling a naked woman in 2017 with the amount of free porn there is] Are users upset about this flood of camgirls? Or are we all just going with it because titties?  rumblebe3: Do you say the same thing about TV because there are adult channels? 

Sure some female streamers may elect to use (ahem) physical assets to appeal to their target audience. It has no bearing on other channels or what you have to watch.

Twitch could certainly improve how it implements their policy on these types of shows across genders, but that is a different conversation. Edo_Tayuya: It's about how the site presents itself, discrimination among users. Don't be so blind and say they have no effect on other people, you god damn fucking sheep.  finmo: I'm with you bro. I feel the urge to protect the purity of twitch but they are changing and fast. I don't watch her channel much but I have respect for the fact that she isn't pretending she's not modeling. There's no bullshit gaming talk or pandering. Orngog: Are you called that at all?  Orngog: That is totally the same conversation randomisation: HE IS A GOLDEN GOD! *GOLDEN!* rumblebe3: Trying to keep it concise is all. There is definitely a double standard over some streamers, and their blanket policies (like the nipple thing) haven't been very well received or effective.

There's also an ongoing issue verifying age on the internet to access content that is not policed or falls within looser guidelines. 

What are your thoughts? bobsp: Go back to /r/incel...oh wait, sorry about your little pity club. egglift: ITS 2017 DONT YOU TELL ME WHAT I CAN AND CANNOT WEAR, REEEEEEEEEEE SEXUAL OPPRESSION REEEEEEEEEE cliu91: I've personally just stopped watching twitch in general now. There's a lot more to filter out, and as a lot of my friends don't game, a few have commented if I watch that soft core gaming website. rumblebe3: Uhh, it doesn't affect me. At all.

I watch a lot of Twitch and some boobs on streams that I'm not watching literally has no bearing on my entertainment.

Umm in terms of discrimination I have no clue what you mean honestly. Are you saying some streamers will feel pressured if other streamers are allowed to show cleavage?

WAKE UP SHEEPLE TWITCH IS STEALING YER HIGHGROUND Orngog: I think firstly twitch needs to redefine themselves as what they want to be. If that means losing the kids or the honeyz, so be it. I personally would be surprised to find they could come up with a sellable catch-all. 

But yes, that's assuming they sincerely care about the age of their viewers.  FishHack: i guess boobs are offensive. or maybe you just don't watch her or her stream. oh well.
 ShutterBun: They should just go ahead and show porn on ESPN,  because adult channels exist. ShutterBun: Supppse Twitch degrades to the point where it becomes 95% cam girls, and gaming streamers find that they can no longer afford to stream, so they fold up their tents and go get jobs.

Then Twitch becomes just another porn site.  Would that affect your viewing? rumblebe3: Is Twitch folding a result of a tidal wave of cam-girls? Are they using too much bandwidth and overloading the servers?

If Twitch degrades to a point that only 5% of the current gaming community remains then yes that would affect my viewing, regardless of cam-girl status.

&gt; fold up their tents and go get jobs

Don't mean to alarm you but many people make a living streaming through Twitch and other sites. Companies and entire industries are leveraging this platform in a financially viable way. I believe that constitutes a job. rumblebe3: Except that that's not what's happening here. Your e-sports stream isn't being attacked by a flurry of breasts, there is a separate channel that has them. 

It certainly isn't promoted content. iplayinthedark: Mmm you're slow. Twitch is ESPN, the e-sports stream is Sports Center.  iplayinthedark: Go do some homework on the topic and come back.  rumblebe3: Then the whole analogy breaks because the whole point is that you can change channels. Twitch is an entertainment service in the same way the your TV is more than an ESPN box. You can watch whatever the hell you want.

To play ball though: If one Sports Center segment shows lingerie football it does not invalidate the existence, or your enjoyment, of Nascar. rumblebe3: They are a streaming platform. Their grounding is in the video game community and they recognise that is their primary offering. 

That being said if you want to stream your pet doing tricks you absolutely can. The onus is on content creators to find where there is demand. 

Hopefully they can establish a working and enforceable code of conduct that doesn't just conform to dated TV standards.  MetalPoncho: i mean you can only regulate people's clothing to a point but there are plenty of streamers who definately take things to far. CogentHyena: This whole thread is a sad mess of toxic gamer bullshit. HER BOOBS GIVER HER TOO MUCH POWER  LETS BAN CLEAVAGE ON TWITCH TO PRETECT THE CONTEEEEENT patrickmanning1: I don't even know what you're talking about so whatever pussy insult you were trying to throw is meaningless. I literally just said the truth. You guys are pathetic. You're giving me down votes cause you don't like the truth? Okay, but down voting my post won't change the fact that every word of it is objectively true. Seldain: You're right dude. We are all wrong. Thanks for the convincing argument. People disagree with you and you call them pathetic. And you're complaining about people disagreeing with you. On the internet. 

You sound like a really awesome and reasonable and intelligent and successful person. I don't understand why people don't take you seriously. Olivesandbullshit: Common interest of gaming, ok. Most gamer dudes can't really get chicks. Those are your 2s. Can you figure out how to make four? patrickmanning1: I am right, though. Notice how your entire reply doesn't contain anything to counter what I've said. JoeHardesty: ""Most gamer dudes can't get chicks""

I'm sorry lol but what?  Olivesandbullshit: Is you tarded?

 chrono4111: The fact that she purposefully pans the camera down so her cleavage is visible is quite telling what kind of streamer she is. Cringe.

JoeHardesty: Buddy I have no idea what the fuck you're trying to say with these comments, take a hike.  Arqideus: That's basically what the IRL section is: a bunch of cam girls who don't have to take off their clothes.   Hypodeemic_Nerdle: They're friends though. She may not be sexually attracted to him, but believe it or not there's more to human relations than hunting for sex. Olivesandbullshit: Ain't no buddy here ya choochoo Charlie.  Olivesandbullshit: His account has a bunch of borderline racist shit  WhiterunUK: REEEEEEEEEE  Edo_Tayuya: You are the most ignorant motherfucker and imbeciles like you are the exact reason this shit is still going on. piev3000: cause one of the site mods for twitch is bias as shit towards camgirls. I forget who but he power trips hard.  rumblebe3: You make a compelling argument.  Edo_Tayuya: Why would I form a proper argument for your dumb ass?

Does everyone seem to have a hateboner for Kait now? Shafu808: In all seriousness, im confused as to why you think shes right in any way in that video?   
  
She gets asked to not record while shes clearly recording.  
She breaks a rule and acts dumb about it.  

Comments are talking about how dumb she is because she acted dumb.   
  
Pretty simple.  iwhitt567: Do you genuinely, honestly not understand why people might judge her for her behavior?

She lied repeatedly to the management at the gym (""I'm not filming""/""I don't have a camera"") after being asked a very reasonable request (to move to a wall instead of a mirror), and wouldn't even get off the ground to *talk* to them. Then after throwing a stupid fit, she went on to claim that she was being kicked out for being white.

That's the kind of selfish, entitled behavior that people tend to not like in others. Protip. npw39487w3pregih: Plus ""trolling"" other people at the gym, she and Ape making fun of that skinny kid?

People get yelled at for looking at their cellphones in the squat rack, and she's Logan Pauling it up with funny masks while messing with camera angles on every machine. That's what did it for me, long before the L of the Day drama. amouranth: The manager previously gave me explicit permission to stream/film.  The bit about ""not caring about members careers"" was a parthian shot at a previous conversation where she said she's very much aware of the ""influencer stuff"" and was attuned to her member's careers (a few personal trainers there have previously asked to be featured in stories or have me in their IG stories).

White was my best attempt at trying to nudge the clip viral; worked I guess xD iwhitt567: ""Haha it's okay I was being an asshole on purpose you see xD"" Blindobb: It didn‚Äôt go viral for that reason you do know that right? Guakstick: Wow, missing the point once more. Yeah, sure you may have been given permission to film YOURSELF at the gym (even though most gyms outright ban filming) but the problem was being in front of the mirror, where you could see other people.

They did not give permission to be filmed/recorded/live streamed. Unless you can find some amazing software on your camera or phone that automatically blurs out faces of people in the background or ask each person who walks behind you (while live), being in front of the mirror is a problem. Moving would have been easy and simple. Mimichah: Don't forget the ""it's because I'm white"" comment. smh",amouranth,"&gt;The manager previously gave me explicit permission to stream/film.

Games like Super Seducer or Until Dawn. 

Thanks, fam! Sir_Zay: Darwin Project. The Show Director has a lot of chat interaction. It was made for Twitch streamers. WeakLost: Darwin Project , it's a steam game . the stream can interact ( vote on things for you to do ) it's fun to play and the games are short.  AoM336: The Jackbox Party Packs

The Escapists

Anything from Telltale Games (try The Walking Dead)

Party Hard, SUPERFIGHT (twitch integration)

Choice Chamber Green-Lime: idk if you did life is strange already... xDagel: I would say any game from the tell tale series, they are pretty good. And there is a couple to choose from. Rob_meatpopscikle: Anything from Telltale Games would fall under the type of game you looking for Blakencakes: Yesss walking dead telltale, game of thrones, etc  IronsevsTwitch: Definitely try Vermintide 2- it is 4 play Warhammer Fantasy like Left 4 Dead but better! afk_bach: I LOVE the Jackbox party games.

 D3vil_0: My suggestion is for a free VR experience from a group called ""Stage 9"" that allows you to walk around and interact with the Enterprise D from Star Trek: The Next Generation. http://stage-9.co.uk/ EmperorCeasar12: Crossing Souls on Steam. Its basically a mix of old school Legend of Zelda, Stranger Things and 80s Saturday Morning Cartoons. I beat it not too long ago so I really recommend playing it. the_ur_to_the_durr: ammo, you might like a game called ""Her Story"", check it out Solidchaos55577: telltale walking dead season 1 S0LEPHaSR: Its not a multiple choice / telltale type game; more action/rpg, But I think you might enjoy it. Ghost of a tale. (its on steam but set to release for consoles this year.) The main character is so cute SFHF

dqj38hv,Amouranth,Amouranth is Supergirl,"lost_in_technicolor: So are these her supposed ‚ÄúNSFW lewds‚Äù? God she‚Äôs pathetic. 

I mean, she‚Äôs obviously talented at making costumes, and arts and crafts. But her content on Twitch and YouTube is incredibly cringeworthy and vapid. The most irritating thing about her is her attitude about it. She streams with her tits and her ass hanging out ALL the time, then she acts like she‚Äôs legit and makes YouTube videos like ‚ÄúOMG someone offered me $3000 for sex! Can you believe it?! Ugh! I‚Äôm just a nerdy comic book nerd and gamer!‚Äù

Why hasn‚Äôt she been banned from Twitch yet? Other people have been banned for stupid mistakes, or just bending over once...

I dunno. It‚Äôs just EVERY TIME I get on Twitch and go to IRL, there she is at the top of the page. It‚Äôs like she streams 12 hours a day just laying around or dancing.  D3vil_0: Well you're just not getting it then, Twitches band or because she hasn't done anything wrong and if you're up upset with her Bob's and butt sticking out then keep your eyes closed dummy and change the channel. lost_in_technicolor: Boobs and ass don‚Äôt ‚Äúupset‚Äù me, but there are other places for that. Twitch is a streaming site for people to interact with chat while they do interesting things (video games, art, music, etc.). Now, I said Amouranth is indeed talented at crafting cosplay and going to conventions. The other shit? She is so cringey at how she takes advantage of horny teenagers. ‚ÄúSquats for subs‚Äù? Come on... it‚Äôs ridiculously obvious, and I‚Äôve seen other streamers get banned for much less blatant behavior. 

And, FYI, yes I go into Amouranth streams every so often because she‚Äôs ALWAYS at the top of the IRL page (for obvious reasons) and I am curious to see what new gimmick she has going on to sucker people out of their money. She rarely seems interested in chat. She‚Äôs always ‚Äúplaying‚Äù that dancing ‚Äúgame‚Äù which is just an excuse to bounce her T&amp;A around. Come on, man. When you get a little older you‚Äôll realize how empty and exploitive her ‚Äúcontent‚Äù is. 

I know several people that work their asses off putting together entertaining streams. They‚Äôre constantly talking with chat. It sucks that a lot of people aren‚Äôt seen because people just see Amouranth at the top of the IRL page and go watch her. Sex sells, and that‚Äôs all she‚Äôs doing when she‚Äôs not actually working on cosplay.  blackldr: I thought someone said she does actual lewds. Seriously this is,her best?

Are there more conventions being reached out to? Are people and #fam reaching out? Should that be something brought through the discord page? Also is there plans for a schedule of the upcoming conventions that are being planned every month that was possibly suggested? I think that if the discord page had a schedule thread, a convention thread, and maybe like a Twitch stream suggestion/poll thread some ideas could be easier to glean from the subs and patron fan base with some easier organization. Personally I love all the streams- it would be fun to see a DnD/Warhammer/mega nerd stream every so often.  tenkini: agreed on all counts I've reached out to my local cons, though they're pretty dinky so who knows.

e4mdzpt,Amouranth,Her Snap,"Gobseck8: Is her Snapchat worth a subscription? Also if I subscribe during a rerun do I still get it? tenkini: Whether its worth it is subjective, i think it is. All subs can get snapchat you just have to link your twitch account to discord (join the server) and then post in the snapchat channel and shell add you after stream KCCOdude: I think the basic question is do you get to see more revealing (I know not newd unfortunately) pictures in the snap that you don't see anywhere else? Or do you just see the same pictures she posts on her platforms? I've wondered the same... or if the $10 patreon is worth it? Is there any material on s.c. or patreon that you can't find anywhere else? TruthWillOutt: With how she has been with Twitch and running reruns until 5 pm EST she probably cycles old pictures often. You've seen her recycle pictures on IG I'm sure.  amouranth: I've never recycled an IG photo for snapchat. real_dyeoxyde: Sub because you like her twitch content, dont sub for snapchat. Look at snapchat as an extra reward for supporting her twitch channel. The stuff on snap is sexy and revealing and original compared to her other socials. 

If you were to sub, you also get access to her discord where all cool peeps hangout, away from the toxic fuckheads (lookin at truth there). There's a snapchat thread you can post there to streamline stuff OR you can message a moderator through discord or twitch if you do not want people seeing your username. :) real_dyeoxyde: If you're a sub, you cannot message a moderator through reddit, we're all the same team, but there's no way to verify your sub on this platform :)",amouranth,I've never recycled an IG photo for snapchat.,0,Female,Amouranth,e4mdzpt,992qmr,11,6,2.8903717578961645

dpgq3xc,Amouranth,Amouranth is Supergirl,"lost_in_technicolor: So are these her supposed ‚ÄúNSFW lewds‚Äù? God she‚Äôs pathetic. 

I mean, she‚Äôs obviously talented at making costumes, and arts and crafts. But her content on Twitch and YouTube is incredibly cringeworthy and vapid. The most irritating thing about her is her attitude about it. She streams with her tits and her ass hanging out ALL the time, then she acts like she‚Äôs legit and makes YouTube videos like ‚ÄúOMG someone offered me $3000 for sex! Can you believe it?! Ugh! I‚Äôm just a nerdy comic book nerd and gamer!‚Äù

Why hasn‚Äôt she been banned from Twitch yet? Other people have been banned for stupid mistakes, or just bending over once...

I dunno. It‚Äôs just EVERY TIME I get on Twitch and go to IRL, there she is at the top of the page. It‚Äôs like she streams 12 hours a day just laying around or dancing.  D3vil_0: Well you're just not getting it then, Twitches band or because she hasn't done anything wrong and if you're up upset with her Bob's and butt sticking out then keep your eyes closed dummy and change the channel. lost_in_technicolor: Boobs and ass don‚Äôt ‚Äúupset‚Äù me, but there are other places for that. Twitch is a streaming site for people to interact with chat while they do interesting things (video games, art, music, etc.). Now, I said Amouranth is indeed talented at crafting cosplay and going to conventions. The other shit? She is so cringey at how she takes advantage of horny teenagers. ‚ÄúSquats for subs‚Äù? Come on... it‚Äôs ridiculously obvious, and I‚Äôve seen other streamers get banned for much less blatant behavior. 

And, FYI, yes I go into Amouranth streams every so often because she‚Äôs ALWAYS at the top of the IRL page (for obvious reasons) and I am curious to see what new gimmick she has going on to sucker people out of their money. She rarely seems interested in chat. She‚Äôs always ‚Äúplaying‚Äù that dancing ‚Äúgame‚Äù which is just an excuse to bounce her T&amp;A around. Come on, man. When you get a little older you‚Äôll realize how empty and exploitive her ‚Äúcontent‚Äù is. 

I know several people that work their asses off putting together entertaining streams. They‚Äôre constantly talking with chat. It sucks that a lot of people aren‚Äôt seen because people just see Amouranth at the top of the IRL page and go watch her. Sex sells, and that‚Äôs all she‚Äôs doing when she‚Äôs not actually working on cosplay.  blackldr: I thought someone said she does actual lewds. Seriously this is,her best?

Does everyone seem to have a hateboner for Kait now? Shafu808: In all seriousness, im confused as to why you think shes right in any way in that video?   
  
She gets asked to not record while shes clearly recording.  
She breaks a rule and acts dumb about it.  

Comments are talking about how dumb she is because she acted dumb.   
  
Pretty simple.  iwhitt567: Do you genuinely, honestly not understand why people might judge her for her behavior?

She lied repeatedly to the management at the gym (""I'm not filming""/""I don't have a camera"") after being asked a very reasonable request (to move to a wall instead of a mirror), and wouldn't even get off the ground to *talk* to them. Then after throwing a stupid fit, she went on to claim that she was being kicked out for being white.

That's the kind of selfish, entitled behavior that people tend to not like in others. Protip. npw39487w3pregih: Plus ""trolling"" other people at the gym, she and Ape making fun of that skinny kid?

People get yelled at for looking at their cellphones in the squat rack, and she's Logan Pauling it up with funny masks while messing with camera angles on every machine. That's what did it for me, long before the L of the Day drama. amouranth: The manager previously gave me explicit permission to stream/film.  The bit about ""not caring about members careers"" was a parthian shot at a previous conversation where she said she's very much aware of the ""influencer stuff"" and was attuned to her member's careers (a few personal trainers there have previously asked to be featured in stories or have me in their IG stories).  There, context. amouranth: &gt;The manager previously gave me explicit permission to stream/film.

White was my best attempt at trying to nudge the clip viral; worked I guess xD iwhitt567: ""Haha it's okay I was being an asshole on purpose you see xD"" Blindobb: It didn‚Äôt go viral for that reason you do know that right? Guakstick: Wow, missing the point once more. Yeah, sure you may have been given permission to film YOURSELF at the gym (even though most gyms outright ban filming) but the problem was being in front of the mirror, where you could see other people.

They did not give permission to be filmed/recorded/live streamed. Unless you can find some amazing software on your camera or phone that automatically blurs out faces of people in the background or ask each person who walks behind you (while live), being in front of the mirror is a problem. Moving would have been easy and simple.

Thats really all they say about her. Dont know why OP made it out to be an entire podcast. Lookitsa3headedmonky: I'd like to know why totalbiscuit thinks lea is a shitty person... (from himself, not from You, whoever You are). Rydisx: well seeing as I heard of Lea, and never heard of this guy before..eh

and after about 5 minutes, he just sounds like an annoying douche who thinks his opinions are right. LousyTshirt: He's more known than Sodapoppin, in the gaming community. Do you live under a rock or something? Rydisx: ive never heard of him. Never seen him on twitch, never been anywhere near top I ever seen. Never seen any article about him ever. LousyTshirt: He doesn't really stream all too much, he's a big youtuber. He has more than 2 mil subscribers on youtube. I can assure you he's more known in the gaming community than Sodapoppin is.
https://www.youtube.com/user/TotalHalibut Rydisx: youtube...lol LousyTshirt: Doesn't matter if you dislike youtube, he's clearly more known overall. myshkinlol: lol he's one of the most known game reviewers doubt he will come to an irrelevant subreddit to comment :P This was about Lea's cancer comment because TB himself also has cancer so it probably hit a nerve. sonotprosgaming: you don't understand how whiteknighting works, if the knight pretends to have never heard of someone then the knight is clearly in the right, also why the fuck am i veiwing a subreddit of some camwhore i need to get my life in check manman6352: Total biscuit is an irrelevant egomaniac , who cares what he has to say, he is worse then lea , at least lea doesn't pretend to be legitimate. Lookitsa3headedmonky: I know who he is, that's why I thought it was interesting that he made such a statement - very unlike him.


Yeah, could be cause of the cancer thing. manman6352: fanboys the lot of you lol. Hockeygod9911: TB is 100x bigger than Lea, lol. dontupvotekthx: Because she is a shit tier human being who thinks cancer kids should die.  Lookitsa3headedmonky: I think she said she thought they were ""meant to die"", there's  a difference.

Saying a stupid thing about cancer kids in a drunken ramble doesn't make a person a ""shit tier human being"" though...


Calm down, have a sandwich, accept the opinions of others, don't hate, think. dontupvotekthx: Alcohol doesn't make you say things you don't believe. It accents and makes louder your beliefs. Lea is  shit scum and Mel Gibson hates jews.  Lookitsa3headedmonky: Don't things ever come out wrong when You say something? More so when you're drunk?

Yeah Mel Gibson clearly hates jews, we can agree on that. 

Did you watch the cancer kids video though? As I remember it, she says something like in a way its good that they die so their genes (which are cancer risk genes by default) are not propagated through generations, causing cancer in their offspring. Or am I remembering it wrong?


Her point is clear enough. Its a fucking stupid thing to say, but it kind of makes sense from a survival of the fittest point of view.

(Also yeah its very politically incorrect to say.) Joulle: Except she did online, on her stream live to thousands of people.
Just the fact that she was drunk on her stream speaks volumes about her. Lookitsa3headedmonky: Lots of streamers have drunk streams. Day9 did drunk streams, JP did drunk streams, Oddone did, it's very common. 

Most adults get drunk from time to time, and find it fun. What is streaming drunk supposed to say about a person? dolphin37: Because not everyone in this world worships immoral sluts.  Lookitsa3headedmonky: There is a difference between worshiping someone and not disliking them. Also did you not read the parenthesis? Here it is again:

""From him, not from You, whoever You are""


Having seen/heard TotalBiscuit lots of times, Im pretty sure he would have more reasoning than what you just posted. I mean come on.


I don't give the tinyest shit about why You dislike her.  dolphin37: no idea why you would capitalise 'you' but obviously expecting anyone in the world other than an individual who is never going to respond to you to explain why they think a certain way is a stupid premise 

obviously there are many reasons for him to say what he did it but I think its fairly obvious to any sane person that its either going to be because of the cancer thing or because she acts like an entitled slut 24/7 on her stream and people who have a reasonable set of values are going to dislike people like that SoulPhoenix: What about basically making her twitch channel a chaturbate channel for money? That's pretty shit tier.  Lookitsa3headedmonky: To be fair, it's pretty far from a chaturbate channel... Did you ever try watching chaturbate? It's way more rewarding in terms of skin shown than any of Lea's streams, 10/10 can recommend.

You can simplify most streams like that. By the same logic you could call day9's channel a cat-fetish channel. Equally wrong and equally stupid.

Btw. all twitch and chaturbate channels involve money. Joulle: I personally find it very inappropriate to be drunk during a live stream, but that is only if the person being drunk knows that (s)he is the kind of person who loses control, acts out stupid or does other inappropriate things one might regret.

In this case, Lea should know better.",myshkinlol,https://soundcloud.com/totalbiscuit/podcast0505#t=59:08,0,Female,legendarylea,4i9ra8,4i9ra8,30,2,3.4965075614664802

Don't be a bundle of sticks, op  soda4head: Gee, I wonder why it became a fap fodder sub for Lea, seeing as her entire stream is usually just her slutting around. 

Maybe if she was a respectable streamer and respect for herself, the sub would be different. If she didn't have weekly ""accidents"", those ""accidents"" wouldn't even be here in the first place.

Those are my thoughts. You can't make a sub for a softcore porno attention whore and expect it to stay civilized without people using it for fapping. soda4head: Are you kidding?

 TheMechazor: If anything, this is basically the perfect fit for what the official Legendary Lea sub should be.

The truth is that 5 year survival rate for children with cancer is 68-98%(depending on the type of cancer) and it is perfectly possible to live a full life if detected early(Source below). So when she goes around telling 1000s of people that children cancer charities are pointless, and lots of people listen to her retarded ramblings and now don't donate anymore.. she might actually kill someone some day.

Leov2: Why would she be banned? If she's pretty much flashed her butthole on stream multiple times each year for like the past two years, showing some clevage and wearing a leotard under leggings won't really do much.

The annoying thing is how harsh she is of other titty/cam streamers. She made a career off flashing her ass and bending over for subs and donations like all the other whore streamers but acts like she's some unique, self-righteous streamer.

EllisIslanders: IDK man polylov: Seeing as how your post was removed from /r/twitch, and she has more viewers than you could ever dream of, it seems the community has spoken. Now take your sexism elsewhere.

You are making such a huge deal over this and witch hunting so hard, honestly it's kind of sad lol. Are you a jealous ex bf or what? legit-lurker: They won't ban her.  They have mods who will kill the stream before something too bad happens. simen: How the fuck is it sexism. Twitch has a policy against this stuff. They come in warning male streamers if they stream with a bare chest (despite this not having any sexual connotations) while allowing girls to flash their bare ass and have webcams tilted down to focus on their tits. /u/soda4head head didn't make any sexist remarks. It's a fact that twitch look the other way for hot girls. MrMagpie91: Because some of the Twitch staff loves her lol. Mess. kaax: Tastes are different but she's way to trashy looking for me. She has the body of a 15 year old girl in puberty and her face is, well, alright looking I guess. Don't know how people get crazy about her I guess it's the ""I'm that easy whore everyone knows I fuck first date"" vibe that connects with social anxiety teenagers on twitch. Like ""wow I think I would have a chance with this chick irl I'm nerdy she probably would think I'm cute and give me a handjob"" Mrbroo: Because she make a lot of money, and if she make money twitchtv make money as well, so here you got your impunity, streamers with low viewers would be instant ban for doing the half she does. (non gaming content, drunk content, sexual content, paid for drink shot of alcool or writing name of donator on her fake boobs, etc...) badhairday2: nailed it haha polylov: You're saying policies can't be sexist? Most policies around the world ARE sexist, and enforcing them is sexist. A woman's chest shouldn't have any sexual connotation either, but the male gaze has decided to shame women for their bodies and bred people like /u/soda4head, who to be quite honest, seems like he might be a bit unhinged a la Mark David Chapman. I am almost considering letting Lea know for her own safety. simen: This is the dumbest thing I've ever seen. /u/soda4head isn't a fucking rapist. He commented on her blatantly breaking twitch's rules and asked how she gets away with it. That isn't exactly grounds for a restraining order. How in the world you got the idea that he's unhinged based on that comment is beyond me.

There's nothing sexist about a rule that applies to both sexes. Except this rule doesn't appear to hold if you're a reasonably attractive woman.

If anyone sounds a little unhinged, it's you. You're projecting an image of some scary dude who's endangering someone's safety based on a comment that is in no way threatening. I think you need to consider what the fuck is going on in your head, because your logic is completely illogical.

Worst white-knighting I've seen so far. polylov: &gt; There's nothing sexist about a rule that applies to both sexes

Ah yes, you know we live in a truly equal society when both the rich and the poor are equally prohibited from sleeping on the streets.

EDIT:
There's also nothing sexist about a law that prohibits abortion, right? I mean it applies to all genders! Honestly your quote was genuinely one of the most stupid things I've read in a looooong time. simen: Nudity and sex aren't specifically a women's issue. Don't put words in my mouth. Honestly your comparison was one of the most stupid things I've read in a loooooong time.

Twitch isn't a porn site. They don't want that stuff on their site, which is understandable. This rule prohibits both men and women from streaming such content. Thus, it doesn't discriminate (at least not in theory, practice is a whole other thing, which is what we're discussing).

What poverty has to do with anything is beyond me. Girls don't *need* to stream their bare butts on twitch.

While MrRepzion is presumably of the opinion that most or all of the incidents involving Lea have been intentional on her part, the fact remains that she claims otherwise, and thus Lea receiving a temporary ban does not necessarily constitute a double standard on Twitch's part unless Twitch likewise disbelieves her.

More generally, he seems to view anything short of a permanent ban as a ""slap on the wrist"", probably because he considers a temporary ban of any duration unlikely to meaningfully impact any streamer's behavior. And more importantly to the particular case of Lea, he fails to even address her claim that the incident was accidental. Presumably he considers that claim so blatantly unbelievable, particularly in light of her lengthy history of approaching the limits of the rules, as to be unworthy of any consideration. However, by so doing he also fails to address Twitch's responsibility as the authority figure in the situation to give that claim at least some consideration, lest they inevitably be accused of unfairness toward another streamer who likewise claims an incident was accidental, such as Genietfan as I mentioned earlier.

Now to be fair, I was unable to personally verify whether Twitch has in fact ever permanently banned anyone, and as such it is possible that he's correct in the respect that Twitch also has a history of administering permanent bans to a streamers who claim that an incident was accidental. In that case, his overall position and accusation of double standards would carry more weight. That, however, would conversely render his failure to even address the issue of Twitch's response to allegedly accidental incidents even more problematic, and in light of his decision to ignore accidental incidents altogether I find it somewhat less likely that he is substantially more familiar than I with evidence of Twitch's overall pattern of responses to intentional as opposed to non-intentional incidents.

He may have a point, and it is certainly possible that Twitch has on the whole displayed a double standard with regards to administering permanent bans exclusively to less popular streamers, but he provides no evidence of that accusation beyond general references to an unspecified number of unidentified banned streamers and the specific case of Lea herself, and as such reduces his argument to little more than his own preconception regarding Twitch's pattern of permanent bans.",madroxide,"you are so right, here, have gold.

Pleb987: you should be happy tho. it's not like its lea's first time showing her poor quality of a female body lol. mrjoshuaco: Red Pill bros. You tough guys are the best. Now quick, be sure to call me a fat cuck before checking on your gains. theLilaQ: You mean the ex-pornstar Mia Rose? And you other fuckin hypocrites, get your facts straight. Most of you are fapping to porn when you are not watching a stream or getting some new CS:GO skins, and now you are butchering this girl for using her body so make a few cents more?
You don't like it, don't watch her stream. Or label the fucking streams (may contain more than 17% human skin visible, zomg!1)

Despite that, Twitch's stance on this is just plain stupid (as are most american media corps'); showing slaughter, beheadings, guts, exploding bodies - all fine. But don't show a nipple or everybody goes batshit crazy.

 nocendi: Is it that different? The only reason MiaRose is known on Twitch is because of her porn background. nocendi: If MiaRose didn't want to base her Twitch fandom on her porn career, why did she use the same fake name? strazyyy: how is that relevant? nocendi: It makes her a fucking hypocrite. 

It's like Snoop telling kids not to smoke weed.  strazyyy: how is she a hypocrite if she didn't flash her vagina on:
#twitch.tv


e: she didnt violate twitch tos by doing porn rofl nocendi: How's that relevant? strazyyy: it's relevant because lea flashed her vag on stream which is against the twitch terms of conduct and mia rose didn't which means that she's not a hypocrite. 

also gj using my response to your strawman nocendi: Yes, she broke the TOS, and yes, she should be banned. However, MiaRose's bitching about how *that ban isn't enough!* **is** hypocritical, because she's making a big fucking fuzz about something she used to do tenfolds herself.  strazyyy: the thing is that she didn't and still hasn't done it on twitch

I understand that it is great to donate to helping children suffering from cancer, however donating to science so that more technology and information about cancer can be found, which can help more people in the future, rather than just helping people now. If some people get an incurable disease/Genetic mutation, instead of mainly caring for them, focus a bit more on science and finding the cure, so that there are way less people in the future to get the disease.  Why_tea_666: If this stupid bitch were to get burned alive, I would take a week off to celebrate. hanneskrr: We are all going to die some day anyway, why even make money and enjoy life while it lasts? Let's just off ourselves right now. 

They need the donations so they can enjoy life, until it lasts since they can't make it themselves and of course to evolve the science needed to cure cancer. 


She is probably just saying all this for publicity, since even bad publicity is good publicity but still, what she is saying is selfish and moronic. 


Fucking whore.  FankyMart: Explain to me how I am misinformed. What I mean is, for example, I'd rather donate my body to science, than donate it for transplant usage, because 1 organ can save 1 persons life, whereas a cure for the disease they have can cure millions. Does that not see like a better idea?  FankyMart: I'm not trying to make myself look knowledgable, because I'm not very, and I was just saying that I think a cure for a disease is far better than saving a couple of kids lives. 
Would you rather save loads of people with a cure because people donated to science and technology, or save 2 or 3 people because they survived from getting extra help from doctors with the money people donated to them. Zerosprodigy: Alcohol can't make you say something you don't mean don't blame drinks on what she is saying  ReVaQ: I mean, she isn't wrong. But the part where she says they are meant to die wasn't correct. There is no meaning really, cancer just happens. One day we will probably be able to do something about it, but when that day comes, if a child gets cancer then they aren't ""meant"" to die.

(from himself, not from You, whoever You are). Rydisx: well seeing as I heard of Lea, and never heard of this guy before..eh

and after about 5 minutes, he just sounds like an annoying douche who thinks his opinions are right. LousyTshirt: He's more known than Sodapoppin, in the gaming community. Do you live under a rock or something? Rydisx: ive never heard of him. Never seen him on twitch, never been anywhere near top I ever seen. Never seen any article about him ever. LousyTshirt: He doesn't really stream all too much, he's a big youtuber. He has more than 2 mil subscribers on youtube. I can assure you he's more known in the gaming community than Sodapoppin is.
https://www.youtube.com/user/TotalHalibut Rydisx: youtube...lol LousyTshirt: Doesn't matter if you dislike youtube, he's clearly more known overall. myshkinlol: lol he's one of the most known game reviewers doubt he will come to an irrelevant subreddit to comment :P This was about Lea's cancer comment because TB himself also has cancer so it probably hit a nerve. sonotprosgaming: you don't understand how whiteknighting works, if the knight pretends to have never heard of someone then the knight is clearly in the right, also why the fuck am i veiwing a subreddit of some camwhore i need to get my life in check manman6352: Total biscuit is an irrelevant egomaniac , who cares what he has to say, he is worse then lea , at least lea doesn't pretend to be legitimate. Lookitsa3headedmonky: I know who he is, that's why I thought it was interesting that he made such a statement - very unlike him.


Yeah, could be cause of the cancer thing. manman6352: fanboys the lot of you lol. Hockeygod9911: TB is 100x bigger than Lea, lol. dontupvotekthx: Because she is a shit tier human being who thinks cancer kids should die.  Lookitsa3headedmonky: I think she said she thought they were ""meant to die"", there's  a difference.

Saying a stupid thing about cancer kids in a drunken ramble doesn't make a person a ""shit tier human being"" though...


Calm down, have a sandwich, accept the opinions of others, don't hate, think. dontupvotekthx: Alcohol doesn't make you say things you don't believe. It accents and makes louder your beliefs. Lea is  shit scum and Mel Gibson hates jews.  Lookitsa3headedmonky: Don't things ever come out wrong when You say something? More so when you're drunk?

Yeah Mel Gibson clearly hates jews, we can agree on that. 

Did you watch the cancer kids video though? As I remember it, she says something like in a way its good that they die so their genes (which are cancer risk genes by default) are not propagated through generations, causing cancer in their offspring. Or am I remembering it wrong?


Her point is clear enough. Its a fucking stupid thing to say, but it kind of makes sense from a survival of the fittest point of view.

(Also yeah its very politically incorrect to say.) Joulle: Except she did online, on her stream live to thousands of people.
Just the fact that she was drunk on her stream speaks volumes about her. Lookitsa3headedmonky: Lots of streamers have drunk streams. Day9 did drunk streams, JP did drunk streams, Oddone did, it's very common. 

Most adults get drunk from time to time, and find it fun. What is streaming drunk supposed to say about a person? dolphin37: Because not everyone in this world worships immoral sluts.  Lookitsa3headedmonky: There is a difference between worshiping someone and not disliking them. Also did you not read the parenthesis? Here it is again:

""From him, not from You, whoever You are""


Having seen/heard TotalBiscuit lots of times, Im pretty sure he would have more reasoning than what you just posted. I mean come on.


I don't give the tinyest shit about why You dislike her.  dolphin37: no idea why you would capitalise 'you' but obviously expecting anyone in the world other than an individual who is never going to respond to you to explain why they think a certain way is a stupid premise 

obviously there are many reasons for him to say what he did it but I think its fairly obvious to any sane person that its either going to be because of the cancer thing or because she acts like an entitled slut 24/7 on her stream and people who have a reasonable set of values are going to dislike people like that SoulPhoenix: What about basically making her twitch channel a chaturbate channel for money? That's pretty shit tier.  Lookitsa3headedmonky: To be fair, it's pretty far from a chaturbate channel... Did you ever try watching chaturbate? It's way more rewarding in terms of skin shown than any of Lea's streams, 10/10 can recommend.

You can simplify most streams like that. By the same logic you could call day9's channel a cat-fetish channel. Equally wrong and equally stupid.

Btw. all twitch and chaturbate channels involve money. Joulle: I personally find it very inappropriate to be drunk during a live stream, but that is only if the person being drunk knows that (s)he is the kind of person who loses control, acts out stupid or does other inappropriate things one might regret.

In this case, Lea should know better.",Lookitsa3headedmonky,"To be fair, it's pretty far from a chaturbate channel... Did you ever try watching chaturbate? It's way more rewarding in terms of skin shown than any of Lea's streams, 10/10 can recommend.

She attacks women donators

They don't think it be like it is, but it do. lingwall88: Could you give some examples? PJBanx: she attacked a female streamer via twitter some months ago and claimed to have the streamers nudes and threatened to post them on a pastebin. acted like a complete maniac then later on deleted all of her twitter posts and claimed that she never had that much fun ""trolling"" when it was obvious to everybody that she wasnt trolling at all but just being the psychobitch she is. last thing she did before the current event was picking on this female streamer named pinksparkles or sth. like that accusing her of everything that she does herself. pretty ironic lingwall88: Well, I personally never heard of the first incident, but I think the pink_sparkles hate was felt by a lot of streamers, I know forsen and Celeste tweeted stuff about her as well as Lea but there were definitely others. I know people accuse Lea of being a camwhore, [but it was nowhere near the level of shit pink_sparkles was pulling.](http://i.ytimg.com/vi/S5oWMODqzK0/maxresdefault.jpg) PJBanx: yeah i wont even watch this, i tuned in for the stream for like 20 seconds and then left when she was first appearing on twitch. it doesnt change the fact that lea is a complete camwhore herself (just look at this subreddit) and therefore it is quite ridiculous to accuse this other streamergirl of anything. i think it is redundant to hate on pinksparkles when she is that obviously disturbed. i mean everybody can see it at first glimpse that something isnt right with her. just let her be, the other streamers just dont like that she is representing in extreme what a lot of them are doing in other ways. that is pulling off a hysterical show with exaggerated reactions and using sexuality to get donations. cHariZmaRrr: i have no clue who pink_sparkles is, but regarding that pic you posted, lea has pulled of stuff where she looked like a way bigger slut than pink_sparkle looks in that pic, though. lingwall88: That was how pink_sparkles's stream was permanently, though. Her cam was always that big, and to be honest, that was one of her less revealing outfits. However, you do have a point. fillelv: Lea is sick in the head...  winner91: Hm, threads like these are usually discussed on Soda's reddit since this sub is usually for her wins.


Anywho, she's a big ass hypocrite. It has been discussed numerous of times on Chance's sub and I've brought it up on a couple threads. She puts herself on a pedestal amongst other women on the internet and thinks she's innocent as a butterfly.

That's the one I saw.   Such a stupid reason.   It's crazy what all these other female casters get away with and you get banned for an underwear ad.

Maybe It's some crazy plot by the twitch admins to get you to show cleavage?    Clearlypro: https://twitter.com/Resubscribe_/status/724694136452849664 AlignedManatee: His name is banned in her stream, too (it shows up as *** when you type chance, soda, sodapoppin) MrMagpie91: She looks so weird. Like she did something to her face. AlignedManatee: Even the mod knows what's up Hi_Im_Armand: It's the fact that other streamers get banned for much less, like watching a youtube video on stream. While she has flashed her ass countless times. People are angry at twitch and their favoritism towards Lea.  just4thrillz: Major violations? He called Kaceytron a hoe on twitter which is not even related to twitch and got a warning for that.... Hi_Im_Armand: I never said perma banned, but banned for less reasons than intentionally flashing private parts. Especially ever since twitch tried to be fair and stop male streamers from being able to stream without a shirt on to avoid sexual content, the amount of warnings Lea specifically has gotten is absurd.  Riposte_This: They need to just ban drinking on Twitch, especially if you're partnered. It's your fucking job, treat it like one. Lea clearly can't handle her alcohol, and fucks up constantly. I actually feel bad for Sodapoppin.  Doubletift-Zeebbee: That's what alcoholism does to you. fasteddeh: The problem is they banned being belligerently drunk on stream already, she just also skates by that rule as if it doesn't exist as well as the no dancing on stream, non gaming/overly sexual content/nudity. name it she doesn't apply to that rule like the rest of twitch does. It's really sad because things like this just leave a black eye on site as a whole as well as most likely gives all the pervert trolls more confidence to be dicks to other women when they stream Hi_Im_Armand: Idiots will always take it too far, but the reason initially was what I stated. Soda is a popular guy, and when Lea cheated on him people turned on her. That could be another reason.  360gunner: Shut the fuck up you disgusting SJW. Get off your high horse. Everything must trigger you people. Why don't you get everyone of your cult members and ho live in a fucking cave. Then you all won't have to worry about everything triggering you! decaboniized: You do realize Krepo was making accusations that he raped someone correct?

Are really just blowing if off from Lea because she is slutty? You brain dead idiots are unreal. She has done this multiple times and if she doesn't get punished it proves Twitch is a complete joke and cares more about money then it's actually reputation.  Riposte_This: Oh I didn't know that man, so many streams get away with it. It's also against Twitch rules to drink for money and some streams literally base entire days on breaking that rule. Yet Twitch does nothing. I'm not saying what Gross Gore said was ok by any means, but I feel like his ban being permanent is a little ridiculous considering Lea and many others just give no fucks  for the rules.  noped2012: I don't care what Krepo said about him. He didn't get on stream and say it. That's the point. All I'm saying is that what he did was way more serious and harmful than what Lea did in my opinion. And you can call me a brain dead idiot all you want haha, it's just my opinion and I stand by it. You sound like you're just mad at the world and somehow whether or not Lea is banned directly affects your livelihood. I honestly just don't give a fuck.... I'd never watch her anyway. Doesn't affect me. I could care less if Twitch has perfect morals, it's a company. There are a ton of companies that do way more fucked up and unethical shit that I'd be worried about before worrying about this but that's just me. fasteddeh: Of course it's ridiculous. The people who get in good with admins will get by breaking any of the rules while those who don't make friends up high are on a obey or be hung as an example standard that way the extreme punishment will let the others be able to do crazy shit and others won't try as much to emulate them putraadibadham: jesus christ Stretch127: People reaaaally dont like this chick. Apparently shes treated chance like shit but I havent seen anything outside that shit with her ex so I dont know. I would really like some videos or something so I can stop feeling like people hate her for no reason. Been watching Charmander for 2 years and I just havent seen it. riddler412: I don't see the vag tbh. Looks like inner thigh. She stoll gets away with so much shit. Yupstillhateme: I'm not trying to be perverted or shit, hut source? I don't use twitch much because my Internet is shit. Is there a reddit post somewhere? EuroDotaLUL: &gt; to be honest without any of this drama, you wouldn't be entertained and running to reddit to talk about it. So everyone here must stfu.

You idiots fail to see this dumb bimbo gets a 30 day ban when if someone was new to twitch they did what she did it would result in a permanent ban. 

Do you fail to understand that or you just an idiot? If you are a company you stick to your policies period doesn't matter if you are popular or make money. 

Sorry you are too much of a dumb fuck to understand.  Champie: Nice b8 m8 HotStrica: You been drinking again Lea ? flasherino_tv: um no i dont want to at all lol Watches_Porn_Alot: The thing that started all the Lea hate IMO is that she kept cheating on Sodapoppin when he was a huge streamer (bigger then he was now).  Makes me livid and even more livid that chance can't realize that she is playing him.  His BEST FRIEND Nick even tried to convince him that she was playing him and he used to HATE Lea with a passion, even going as far as saying as long as she lives in the same house Chance and Nick do he will not help pay the bills for her.  Sadly in the end Nick somehow got brainwashed by her too.  Shes a manipulative whore and without a vagina (she has no tits), she would be working the drive thru at mcdonalds 7 days a week.

cuxbknf,KittyKatGaming,the Nintendo problem explained,"Dutch_Wilkerson: Tl;dw:

-Nintendo send Suzy a copy of Mario maker. ""Play our game!""

-Suzy plays game, video gets claimed by Nintendo, all revenue goes to them. 

-Suzy is told to re-monetize video she has to join the Nintendo MCN and split (all?) her revenue with Nintendo.

-Suzy says fuck that bullshit and never plays another Nintendo game on her channel.
 TJ_Hipkiss: Sounds like Suzy's fault tbh. Sure, Nintendo's policies are not good and do not make it easy for someone not part of a big network to make money from their videos, but it seems like she was just being a bit ditzy about the whole thing. This isn't a ""how was she supposed to know?"" situation. If she's trying to make money as a Let's Player, then she should at least be aware of this system that has been put in place for months now and has gotten high-profile attention in the gaming community. Nintendo probably could have mentioned it in the e-mail at some point, but Suzy has got to be more professional than that and actually put some effort in y'know.",Dutch_Wilkerson,"Tl;dw:

Also there was another time (I believe in DKC3) that Ross and Arin were discussing an art thief (posted someone's animation on their facebook with no credit) where Ross called him a cunt and told Kevin to not censor it because it's very true.

Edit: found it, it was Sonic 3. https://youtu.be/LAmIuMdE1yw?t=6m20s Anyway, it just kind of implies that they do regularly censor it if it slips out of their mouths.

I don't understand why the line was drawn where it was, but it seems most people think that cunt is the one swear word to be afraid of other than racial slurs. People are just overly sensitive here sometimes.

like for example I would like to see Suzy play Cavern Kings because I think she would like the characters and music 
 bronwynsings: I would love to see Suzy play Hatoful Boyfriend, I think it would be fun and I'd love to see her reactions to the more outlandish story lines.  MrLaughter: one of the Pokemon Dungeon games, that's puzzl-y, right?

I'd also love to hear her take on Bayonetta, the latest Tomb Raider, or even the Metroid games.  Perhaps with Holly or her sister, we could hear some fun stories. Huge_DisgustingBrain: Seconding the Pokemon Dungeon games! Although the 3DS one isn't anywear near as good as the DS games imo and I imagine that's what Suzy would hypothetically play. WoodPlanking: I remember suggesting tomodachi life. Also, Puzzle and Dragon: Super Mario edition. Looks fun but I need convincing.  bronwynsings: That would be a lot of fun! I'm sure she'd make tomodachis of all the Grumps. TheDemonPirate: with Holly please SeeYouSpaceCorgi: Oh yeah, I had a blast playing the latest Tomb Raider, be great watching her play! MrManicMarty: Long Live the Queen might work well honestly, might work well with someone else tagging along as well.

As you're probably well aware of the recent [Reddit Blackout](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/3bxduw/why_was_riama_along_with_a_number_of_other_large/), you've most likely noticed that a lot of other subs are shutting down in protest. 

The mods have discussed whether or not we should too, and we have decided against it. We don't want to punish the community by depriving them of the Kitty Kat Gaming Reddit discussion outlet OR Suzy herself by taking away a subreddit devoted to her. While we would like to take some action, we here have more to loose than we have to gain in any of this and we just don't want to do this to you guys. 

In saying that, we do support those subs taking protest, and encourage users to learn about what is going on so that people are well up to date with the currant site wide situation.

csqir1j,KittyKatGaming,Suzy's thoughts on Momo.,"[deleted]: To be honest, and I'm not implying Suzy's a hypocrite here, I'm wondering why she's starting to have a problem with the objectification of women at this point of the game, with Momo. It's made pretty clear early on that the goal of the game is to sleep with women, and that all the girls are meant to have a little ""sleazy kink"" to them. (Gamer girl, Milf, School girl, Teacher, ""Chocolate"" girl, etc)

Momo's inclusion in the game ticks off two fetishes on the checklist of fetishes represented in the game. She's a catgirl, and she's submissive. She's a *submissive catgirl*  because that's just a common trope for catgirls on the internet. It just makes sense, it's an efficient way of giving people playing the game what they might want.


As for the misogyny (the purpose of the game itself aside), Momo's inclusion in the game effects real life women even less than the other characters, because unlike the others, she's a representation of a *fictional* creature. Even if this game did have an effect on how women would be treated, no catgirls would be harmed any of this.


This might be an unpopular opinion but I'm just defending the point of the game here and saying what I felt should be said. Downvotes are welcome, but discussion is moreso. eulerhopepunk: I think it's amusing because Suzy gets labeled an SJW a lot by her detractors, but if you've ever seen the Huniepop Twitter... WoodPlanking: Hunniepop twitter? 

https://twitter.com/HuniePop

Huh. Mr. Pop sure has some words to say and he sure is saying them. WoodPlanking: Ye. I agree. This game is obviously just ""hey play the puzzle part so you can see their boobs and hear them moan"". So its a little Silly to complain about that. However, I doubt this is the state of mind Suzy is in when complaining about it.  Backerel: The problem I have with Momo is the way she acts and talks. It's almost like a little girl. I found it extremely disturbing. I thought maybe it's just me but when I asked my girlfriend she had the same opinion.
The game is really fun and surprisingly adictive. And all the other characters are so over the top and stereotypical that at moments it makes me think is a parody. So I think they are so irrealistic that they end up being more funny than ofensive. That said, Momo is too much for me. SeeYouSpaceCorgi:  I think in saying what you said you proved two other things. It either further proves my point, and it also proves shows how fetishes have an impact on your preference of girl priority in this game. You're right, her childishness nature may come across as weird to a few people, but that's just another fetish, it's Ageplay or Babygirl. Either way, if you don't like it and find it off-putting, it's just something that the game doesn't cater for you 100% and like the rest of the game, the same way I don't find the porn actress or the stewardess thing attractive/offputting. But I'm not gonna suddenly start to say the game's gone too far because it's just too good at what it was saying it was in the first place.

Sure though, I will agree that sub/dom play is a little more intense than the other fetishes, but the dev helped people out this way by making us work for Momo. She's a *hidden* character so people don't have to have that fetish rubbed in people's faces. You actually have to go out of your way to find her in the first place. chuma93: to be fair, arin said all that and she agreed, i think suzy does want to make her channel in a politically correct ground for some reason. which i found quite naive 
im hoping  she could just relax a little. if she starts worrying for any little offensive thing she never will be able to do a show  Huge_DisgustingBrain: &gt; at moments it makes me think is a parody

Only trying to help out by saying you are easily missing out on over 66% of the weapon's potential!

The weapon is complex and you can do so many things with it, therefor i can understand that some things are left unnoticed. But here are 2 things that you can easily start adding to you play that will more than double your damage output on monsters:

- Get the insect's red buff!!! (usually by throwing your insect on the monster's face) This buffs gives ALL your attacks an extra hit (double the DPS right there with 1 easy thing!)

- I've notice you only use the (x+x+x) combo. At the end of this combo, there is a very long animation where you aren't attacking and you are more vulnerable to attacks. You should use the (x+x+a) or (x+x+x+a) combo. Those combo can chain into each other so there is never a downtime where you aren't attacking!


You dont have to master everything there is about the insect glaive because there are a lot of things to consider with that weapon (pole vaulting, insect manipulation, etc). But you should definetly incorporate those 2 tips into your gameplay and it will change your view on the weapon.

e3e358b,lilypichu,destiny defending lily and poki,"Zuggtmoy: ABATHUR get her on for a debate! ABATHUR r2002: &gt;Yeah for Lily... I can see that.

lol. Seriously though, I agree with Destiny that even if all the accusations are true, so what? If one day Lily said ""oh yeah I sometimes fake my voice"" I'm not sure that would matter to me. Lily's a voice actress and she especially aspires to VA anime stuff. So if she often hams up the anime voice during stream I assume that is just her flexing her skills and demonstrating her range.

I've never heard her say anything sexual or inappropriate -- except to make Wendy uncomfortable ha ha. In fact if I have kids Lily's stream would be one of the few I would feel unconditionally comfortable letting them watch. Zuggtmoy: Imagine, for example, accusing voice actress of faking her voice LOOOOOOOL r2002: Next thing you're going to tell me is that Steven is not actually controlling intergalactic swarm of biological drones in an desperate war of domination versus an ancient race of psionic beings and platoons of cyberneticly enhanced humans. RiosCDN: When he said, oh wait, Poki is showing her feet in this pic, I guess that makes her a whore, I actually started laughing pretty hard. 

Seriously though I get the point she is trying to make but she doesn't make good points and has bad examples because she just wanted to attack big streamers instead of finding girls who actually do it and again with Destiny's point, who cares? Don't watch. lilypichu: Steven's cool ‚ù§

In all seriousness though I've seen girls like this a lot. Trying to tear others down, make themselves look good, i.e. I'm not like the other uwu girls!! which is super hypocritical when you think about it. It's sad but I hope in the future she redirects her efforts into something less hateful and more productive. This is not a path she'll look back on and be proud of. 

The only point she kinda had was the zombi girl thingy, but we legit resolved that so many times through DMs and there's only so many times that same topic can be brought up. But that doesn't fit her narrative, so...  shunsui_sexton: She has taken the video down, i'm guessing she got a wave of dislikes. aznperson: you should draw whiteknight steven chibi for defending your honor (because it would trigger him) 

but yea it seems like she made the video to start drama or she has the Mitchjones syndrome where she thinks every except her her is fake  oriannaagrande: Its still there. Comments are just deleted. Odd considering she was so confident proving the ‚Äúwhiteknights‚Äù in the comments wrong &gt;.&gt; Masskid: &gt; ""As a high voiced girl who likes cute clothing""

Hates on other high voiced girls who likes clothing ._. jpmaaaaarx: Update: She either made the video private, or she removed it LUL.  porkboi: I'm late but DELET EmperorMagikarp: This is just a click bait video. What she is hoping for is bigger streamers/youtubers to talk about her, cause drama, and therefore garner her more views. I certainly didn't know about her before this. Talking about this type of content only feeds this type of content. Best to just walk away. I love Steven, he is a pretty funny dude, but he is giving her views. 

On a more personal note, it could be that she posted this because she is insecure about herself. She sees these big name streamers (who some might say she is similar to) get a lot of hate (because this is the internet and any idiot with an opinion will be heard by the masses) for basically just being themselves and making content people enjoy (Especially when it comes to her mentioning you, Poki, and Jaime [I don't think I know any of the other streamers/tubers] ). It is very possible that people give her a lot of hate for the same stuff. 

Rather than ignore the hate (I'm not saying it's easy, stuff gets to everyone sometimes), many people, such as this person, try to hop right on that hate train and blame the ""real problem"". Problem is, hopping on the hate train won't stop your haters. It will only attract more people who enjoy hopping on that hate train. A fanbase will become more and more toxic the longer people do this. It's generally not sustainable longterm, and it is extremely stressful to be around all that negativity. 

Part of the reason I love your community, and the overall community of OTV/JF in general, is that for the most part people are pretty gosh darn wholesome. You have painstakingly cultivated  a garden in which your viewership frolics with glee. I hope this other person learns that true happiness and acceptance comes from within and can do the same. jpmaaaaarx: She's someone who hates on people without doing proper research LUL. And besides, she just named Poki as a ""Loli e-girl"" when she's the furthest from that (and besides, there's nothing wrong with being one, if it's a persona that attracts viewers. Then i say go the fuck with it). 

The way she handled the amount of dislikes was clever though, I'd give her that. What she did is that she deleted the specific video, then made a new one and wrote comments like ""Oh guys this is more a general video now. Because  a ""certain"" person got salty "" and bla bla bla. And since the other vid got deleted, you dont have anything to prove her stupidity.",shunsui_sexton,"She has taken the video down, i'm guessing she got a wave of dislikes.",0,Female,lilypichu,e3e358b,93ez16,15,8,3.1780538303479458

e5bawan,lilypichu,Appreciation for Lily's performance yesterday. She was clutch in game 2,"doobiehaskillz: I'm pretty sure qt was being sarcastic he didn't try to side step at all. r2002: She made a bunch of good decisions to get that kill though. She out-roamed Ahri. She didn't try to panic ult from afar. She didn't get rattled by the turret and shielded herself. She moved in at a good aggressive angle. She didn't get distracted by Heimer and kept the focus on Mord. She held her Q for as long as possible to bait out any flashes. (Which is something BoxBox said during practice -- that Lily should hold on to her CC as long as possible before committing). 

These things might not seem hard, but imagine doing that in front of a huge critical audience going up against some of the best players of all time.

Later on the QT's team was keeping track of Lily more. They saw she had a lot of kills and was even trying to target her -- not for memes but because they consider her the main damage (and boxbox)

I think towards the end of the game I saw QT bring up the scoreboard when Lily had the best KDA on her team (and maybe overall -- although I think Scarra may have tied or was slightly better). Nhillation: The fact that she was able to stand on even ground or even out-perform ex-pro players is impressive in itself. Seriously impressive performance from her. naapb: [This was pretty good too](https://clips.twitch.tv/BrightNiceAntNotLikeThis) r2002: Yeah she had a lot of great plays! I'm usually too lazy to clip anything even though I've been on Twitch for years this is the first time I ever clipped something.

This is definitely a great play. I think she also had a couple of max range and/or double kills with her ult as well. She really love those dogs ha ha. lilypichu: Omg thank you T_T i tried rly hard haha.
 Was fun!!! Would do again but with 4 challengers on my team üòã r2002: You were great Lily! You had me at the edge of the seat during this sequence.

So I don't know how much will I pay but I wanted to know if anyone knows about these and would like to know how much does it cost because I don't want to pay 20-30‚Ç¨ of import duties :'(

Sorry for my english, and thanks for reading have a nice day :) Vecdes: Yeah! I want those things too! Please let us know! :D Kyrooa: If it‚Äôs below 42‚Ç¨ you don‚Äôt need to pay any charge  xeqqone: Ikr ? They are sick merch, I'm in love with the hoodies haha :D xeqqone: Really ?! I hope it does applies for France too then :D Kyrooa: In all EU xeqqone: Hey, thank you for answering :)

I guess I'll try since $48 is the equivalent of 41‚Ç¨ so let's hope I won't get to pay any taxes :)

If I remember I'll try to update this thread when the hoodie will be delivering to my house so mid october I guess so yeah. andiwouldwalk500more: No problem mate.

It should say on your country's customs website if you will owe taxes. gabittner: Import/customs duties are only charged on orders 150‚Ç¨ or more. 

The threshold for VAT varies across EU country. If you are above it you have to pay your regular VAT rate. In Germany the minimum is 22‚Ç¨ and the VAT rate 19%. So on a 41‚Ç¨ hoodie you'd pay 7,79‚Ç¨ VAT. xeqqone: Exactly ! I checked my country's custom website ( France ) as andiwouldwalk500more told me and indeed the VAT rate is 19% so 7,79‚Ç¨ , that's not too bad I guess :)

Thanks for helping :D",andiwouldwalk500more,"No problem mate.

This goes on for about 2 and a half hours. *Every* time I check, there's always those ""~5 users here now"" and I can't help but wonder if they're just like me in a way.

AmeliaAddis0605: Who is your favorite bts band member Casseerole: What do you feel about the current state of MMOs as someone who grew up on them? Are there any you're particularly interested in trying? CamilliaFlowers: If you weren't streaming and with offline tv, what would you be doing right now?  Mia0605: What would you say to someone who wants to start streaming but are to scared to put themselves out there and of drama?  Clean_Paper: What is your favorite meme of all time? FireSt0rm9: You ever plan on continuing you Dark Souls 3 playthrough? I loved watching that. üòÅ BlutigeBaumwolle: Any chance of a Nier Automata strim in the near future? Quasaru: Who are some of your favorite community artists and favorite fan art that you've enjoyed the most so far? Darkklaw: Hello! Please keep it to one question per person at a time! Xexanos: I remember that back in the day you rarely had a face cam in your streams and if you did you had some big sunglasses covering up your face.

What was it that made you overcome your shyness/insecurities? BlutigeBaumwolle: Oops. I removed one of them. Darkklaw: Thank you! Cpt_Barricade: if temmie could talk what voice would she have  iLuvwaffless: Hey Lily, as a long time viewer I really miss your piano compositions and I suppose this is more of a request rather than a question but would it be possible to upload some of your most recent songs up on youtube? (Meme things like joast theme song, destinys song, etc.) It seems that your youtube is mostly highlight from your stream but I think it would be great if we saw more music on there. Especially now that you can have albie collab with you. I really love when you two just jam out on stream and would love to have videos to listen to at will instead of having to hunt down vods. huyenlinh: who is your favourite influencer/content creator at the moment? (youtuber, streamer, VA, etc) Perpetualinvalidity: Hey!

The crisis line that I work for in MN is closing down. We used to handle all the mental health crisis and suicide line calls. I still really want to work in this area, so I'm thinking of starting a twitch channel based around playing some games and chatting with people who are going through some rough stuff, for support. What do you think of this idea? I would love opinions from others too. madforpeace: Hey Lily! I like your humor &amp; content! 
My question: who is your favorite youtuber?  Darkklaw: Since you would love opinions from others too:
It definitely sounds like an interesting idea, although it might attract a relatively niche audience and take a while to take off.

That said, I would suggest having a good look at the Twitch ToS. I don't know it in depth but I would not be surprised if some of the things in there might be relevant, even if only because of trolls this type of content might attract. Perpetualinvalidity: That is a very good idea. I also have my eyes on various HIPAA compliance and how that would work given that it's a public broadcast medium. louufy: What keeps you up at night?  UndyingNito: Hey Lily, what is your favourite thing to do in your freetime with temmie/offline tv members?

If you're passionate about something, it will show. As for drama, that'll only really happen if you choose to involve yourself in such things OR you become big enough so that people make drama about you, in which case I'd consider that a win. lilypichu: nier is one of those games i keep saying i'll play soon but I keep holding off because I keep forgetting... LOL lilypichu: Honestly, if I could become a full time, professional voice actress, that'd be the dream.

It's around here somewhere and it'd nice if you did because he's somewhat insecure about himself and while I think that's due to the hyperbolized aggression from his peers I also think that it's due him feeling that he isn't heard.

Was  just wondering because I just watched MagikarpUsedFly's old video about this and I know that there are streamers who dont like their stuff being put onto the said videos.

Also, JOAST is just a meme. spookyahoy: Do you ever miss home? BeekaChuuu: Hi lily I just wanted to say hi and that a lot of people have mistaken me for you in a lot of games that have voice chat in!

I just bought my own starbucks cup and make my own coffee now lol lilypichu: Yep! Thought it was slow in some parts but overall not t e r r i b l e ... lilypichu: Decent tech setup (audio, cam, computer). Ask yourself what you have to offer amidst the heavily saturated streamer population (are you good at games? Good personality? Good looking? Fulfill a niche role?). And then if you see an opportunity to collaborate, do so.  lilypichu: If her asks, certainly! lilypichu: Idk if I've ""made it"" but I still haven't stopped pursuing voice acting! That, and publish a children's book. :) lilypichu: D: Japanese..? Sushi is good. But Chinese has SO much variety. But I'm Korean...

However, the Korean language in terms of reading and writing is built to be simple and easy to learn. (It was created originally by King Sejong because the peasants could not afford to learn how to read chinese, which is what koreans originally used as their language). The harder part will be pronounciation. lilypichu: i haven't updated in a while so it'd be pretty outdated by now lilypichu: futaba lilypichu: they'd be called..temmimi lilypichu: ; - ; i don't know lilypichu: k-on?...

On top of that, there are still all these haters that seem to have nothing better to do in life than to write rubbish and make up lies about you and resort to swearing and abuse when a fan tries to defend you, I can relate to how this must feel, since my life has been filled with being treated like im completely worthless and having next to no friends in life, just recently trying to sell something on facebook marketplace and being accused of being a scammer for no reason and them having no evidence whatsoever... Honestly Lily, you are such an unqiue, special, amazing soul... all the things you do for all your friends and fans.. and all the hate you have to put up with on a regular basis...

My uncle knew I was a fan of Lily, so he called me if I wanted to join. I accepted. We got to the front door and I knocked the door. Poki answered and let us in. I asked Poki where Lily‚Äôs room was and I went to her room as fast as I could.

.    I introduced myself and she asked me if I would want to join her singing class which was right then. I gladly said yes. After I practiced singing, I asked her if I could be in a video, she said sure. Then few minutes later, I asked her if I could be in a livestream, She took a few minutes to think about it, then she said, ‚ÄúWell... Your vocals are pretty good... (Okay, IRL my singing is really bad) Yeah you can be in my livestream.‚Äù (At this point this is where my dream stopped, but here an extended story)

.    The next day I got to the OfflineTV house and I was in the livestream. I promoted my YouTube channel. I would say, ‚ÄúWhile you‚Äôre watching Lily‚Äôs stream why not sub with Twitch Prime! It‚Äôs free! Just link your amazon account to twitch, and you have Twitch Prime! Also, who not consider subscribing to my YouTube channel?‚Äù As the day went on, I stayed at the OfflineTV house and got to know everyone.

.    I asked Poki if I could join OfflineTV, she said, ‚ÄúOnly for one day. We‚Äôll be streaming today, so you can pop in our stream and say hi.‚Äù I said okay and I asked if Lily was sleeping. I went to her room and while she was sleeping, I went on to her computer, then started streaming. I opened word then wrote a letter thanking her for letting me be in her livestream, Twitch chat helped me write the letter.

.    In the middle of writing the letter, she woke up and approached me.

I feel like the gentle aura they have would compliment with you nicely. 

For outside of that, I would say kagome/kikyo from Inuyasha or someone from legend of zelda, like Sheik, Farore, or Nayru. Oh, maybe Link/Linkle from any of the games if you want. DommyNommy: Ms. Kobayashi? this one looks really good by the way!

On a more serious note, looks amazing!

AmeliaAddis0605: Who is your favorite bts band member Casseerole: What do you feel about the current state of MMOs as someone who grew up on them? Are there any you're particularly interested in trying? CamilliaFlowers: If you weren't streaming and with offline tv, what would you be doing right now?  Mia0605: What would you say to someone who wants to start streaming but are to scared to put themselves out there and of drama?  Clean_Paper: What is your favorite meme of all time? FireSt0rm9: You ever plan on continuing you Dark Souls 3 playthrough? I loved watching that. üòÅ BlutigeBaumwolle: Any chance of a Nier Automata strim in the near future? Quasaru: Who are some of your favorite community artists and favorite fan art that you've enjoyed the most so far? Darkklaw: Hello! Please keep it to one question per person at a time! Xexanos: I remember that back in the day you rarely had a face cam in your streams and if you did you had some big sunglasses covering up your face.

What was it that made you overcome your shyness/insecurities? BlutigeBaumwolle: Oops. I removed one of them. Darkklaw: Thank you! Cpt_Barricade: if temmie could talk what voice would she have  iLuvwaffless: Hey Lily, as a long time viewer I really miss your piano compositions and I suppose this is more of a request rather than a question but would it be possible to upload some of your most recent songs up on youtube? (Meme things like joast theme song, destinys song, etc.) It seems that your youtube is mostly highlight from your stream but I think it would be great if we saw more music on there. Especially now that you can have albie collab with you. I really love when you two just jam out on stream and would love to have videos to listen to at will instead of having to hunt down vods. huyenlinh: who is your favourite influencer/content creator at the moment? (youtuber, streamer, VA, etc) Perpetualinvalidity: Hey!

The crisis line that I work for in MN is closing down. We used to handle all the mental health crisis and suicide line calls. I still really want to work in this area, so I'm thinking of starting a twitch channel based around playing some games and chatting with people who are going through some rough stuff, for support. What do you think of this idea? I would love opinions from others too. madforpeace: Hey Lily! I like your humor &amp; content! 
My question: who is your favorite youtuber?  Darkklaw: Since you would love opinions from others too:
It definitely sounds like an interesting idea, although it might attract a relatively niche audience and take a while to take off.

That said, I would suggest having a good look at the Twitch ToS. I don't know it in depth but I would not be surprised if some of the things in there might be relevant, even if only because of trolls this type of content might attract. Perpetualinvalidity: That is a very good idea. I also have my eyes on various HIPAA compliance and how that would work given that it's a public broadcast medium. louufy: What keeps you up at night?  UndyingNito: Hey Lily, what is your favourite thing to do in your freetime with temmie/offline tv members? 


P.S. I've enjoyed your content for a long time and it helped through darker times, thank you. VicKe63: Hey Lily! What countries do you want to visit in the future? TehLewLew: thats a bit of a loaded question lmao nintendodog1: If you could choose a waifu from Darling in the FranXX, between Kokoro, Ichigo, Zero Two, Mitsuru, Ikuno, and old Nana who would it be and why? dennisri: Hi Lily, did you enjoy conservatory and how did you like being in an environment filled with other musicians?  Charge72002: What makes you happy? oppaniichan: Do you prefer persona Lily or irl-based Lily when it comes to fanart these days?  ALonleyRacoon: Did you ever expect being so famous with 1,000,000 fans? good_form_pupper: How well did you do in highschool Jelliots: Hey Lily, want you to know you're super entertaining and have inspired me to save money to buy a piano and learn how to play. My questions this: how do you like creating content for a living and being a part of a group like OfflineTV? It's my life goal to create videos and what not as a career. Silvertrials:  Would you give up streaming and producing content on Youtube for voice acting?  Anthuni: Why are you so perfect :(  acnehunter: are you d8ing abie?

inb4 i watch my friends KawaiiLu: doot doot, hi lily!
i have a question, will u be going to crunchyroll expo? :o lilypichu: that's gonna be a big yikes from me dawg lilypichu: bunch of things. age, maturing, fixed my jaw, learned make up, more self confidence.  lilypichu: declining for sure, but I'd be open to trying mmos since they were a part of my childhood really. I liked maple story 2! lilypichu: annoying high pitched. hey kinda like her owner! c: lilypichu: when you start, your community will be super supportive. smaller communities are often like that. nothing to be scared of. If you're passionate about something, it will show. As for drama, that'll only really happen if you choose to involve yourself in such things OR you become big enough so that people make drama about you, in which case I'd consider that a win. lilypichu: nier is one of those games i keep saying i'll play soon but I keep holding off because I keep forgetting... LOL lilypichu: Honestly, if I could become a full time, professional voice actress, that'd be the dream. But I don't think I'll ever stop creating content naturally, whether it's art, music, or videos. Doesn't have to be for a living, but I think I'll still at least make stuff! lilypichu: AM I A GOOD OWNER

DO YOU LOVE ME

WHY DO YOU POOP IN THE LIVING ROOM SOMETIMES?

WHY DO YOU CRY SOMETIMES?

DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU? lilypichu: oh god no.. ;\_: lilypichu: Yeah I really should :( music is a big part of my life and I agree I should be focusing on that more.

A random link.  lilypichu: I love both! I love all fanart!!! lilypichu: I almost failed HS.  lilypichu: hmmm.. I dunno. I feel like things happened for a reason. Like, if I didn't experience certain things I wouldn't be the person I am now.  lilypichu: fffkkkk I genuinely enjoy watching my friends though ;\_\_; lilypichu: \- I enjoy riced cauliflower a lot with egg and some kind of meat.

\- I did! It's on my soundcloud but I wanna redo it..

\- Nope

\- My birthdays =D My mods and fans make it so nice every year. HaineBot: Lily, what are some of your favourite VA?  lilypichu: I love trying to teach Temmie new tricks, or just cuddling with her, playing with her, petting her, hugging her. I love her existence so much haha. I usually hang out in the living room and watch stuff with Fed, Albert or maybe Scarra once in a while. 

And I'm super happy to hear that. &lt;3 lilypichu: I'd love to visit Japan again. I also wanna visit Singapore!  lilypichu: jeez I don't know the thought depresses me. I genuinely don't know what I would be doing...  lilypichu: albie, temmie, friends, fans, art, music, good food, good company, accomplishments, voice acting :) lilypichu: I love it, I think I'm very fortunate and I'm constantly reminded of that every day. I hope you achieve your dreams as a content creator as well!  killerfrenzi: If you were able to interact and tell your past self about how you are doing now, how would past Lily of 3 and 5 years ago react? lilypichu: mostly just thinking about stuff. Random stuff. Life.  xmidn1ght: Are you ever going to come to Australia in Melbourne? GreenDaBean: Did you answer my good friend vinhtages question? It's around here somewhere and it'd nice if you did because he's somewhat insecure about himself and while I think that's due to the hyperbolized aggression from his peers I also think that it's due him feeling that he isn't heard. Hi vinh :) cdausch: What time do you usually go to sleep? TIWIMEISTER: Hey Lily, what are some genre's of music you'd like to indulge/interested in but never actually thoroughly checked out. Panzy7: Can't watch anime for your entire life or Can't see albert (even pictures or vids) for your entire life?  jpmaaaaarx: Hi Lily, what are your thoughts regarding clips from your stream being put into stream highlights/compilations videos? 

Was  just wondering because I just watched MagikarpUsedFly's old video about this and I know that there are streamers who dont like their stuff being put onto the said videos.

Also, JOAST is just a meme. spookyahoy: Do you ever miss home? BeekaChuuu: Hi lily I just wanted to say hi and that a lot of people have mistaken me for you in a lot of games that have voice chat in! I never really noticed that my voice sounds like you? But have always been watching since day 1! My question is what is your favourite Kpop group and why?  Ratix0: Come Singapore! We'd like to see you here :D. All the rhythm games are here too! Rhaidot: Do you like Noragami? I just discovered it recently. I knew of Yato as a meme, but I was actually surprised for the quality of the story and the fights were well done. looking forward to watch second season and hopefully the manga will have a proper ending after coming back from such long hiatus.

Lily, thanks for your content and keep going, try to have as much fun as you can because you deserve it :D UndyingNito: That is lovely, thank you for your answer and stay comfy.  Jelliots: &lt;3 xianaru: Heey Lily! :D Do you like drinking coffee (like Starbucks)? Azusalove: Out of curiosity, have you seen ‚ÄúGakkou Gurashi!‚Äù? It‚Äôs an anime that I believe it would fit your tastes. 


Also if you haven‚Äôt seen it and decide to watch it, you need to go into it blind for the full experience. (:  justaprocrastinator: Do you think you'll do another ''if league of legends was an anime'' with RTB in the future? I really liked them rockstarpoe7: What's your favorite thing to do on lazy Saturday morning? reallynicememebuddy: Hi Lily! I feel like it's pretty common for people at the top of their field to feel a desire to move on to some kind of new challenge. It's pretty safe to say you've ""made it"" as a content creator, so do you ever get the urge to move on from what you're doing now and fully devote yourself to some other field? FeedyHS: Hi Lily, french fan here, just wanna ask, what's your opinion on Wrestling ? dareenc: Hey lily! If you had to eat one type of cuisine for the rest of your life, what would it be? (i.e. Korean, Chinese, Japanese etc.) EmilyIsBetterThanYou: lilly i entered the code to talk to you on discord it disappeared how am i suppose to talk to you?  athenafowl: Greetings Lily,

How is the relationship between Poki's kitten and your doggo Temmie?

Thank you :B randomusers1234: Hey lily :D my friend is a big fan so I gotta ask, Is 5'3 too short :^)? Also could you say Hi to Clara &gt;:D Kazutaya: HEY LILY DO U PERSOANLLY USE CRUNCHYROLL PREMIUM OR NAW Pepperpost: Thank you for your submissions!

I'd just say be careful of Twitch ToS, like the person before mentioned, and make sure you don't burn out too. It sounds like a very stressful, but rewarding, endeavor.  lilypichu: old nana is pretty cool. red hair gets me.  lilypichu: might as well while i'm relatively young :'\_) lilypichu: not sure, but we'll see. there might be other plans coming up! lilypichu: i really wanna do a sayaka + violin boy cosplay with albert :D lilypichu: kana hanazawa lilypichu: 5 years ago lily: no wai why would ppl watch me LOL

I just bought my own starbucks cup and make my own coffee now lol lilypichu: Yep! Thought it was slow in some parts but overall not t e r r i b l e ... lilypichu: Decent tech setup (audio, cam, computer). Ask yourself what you have to offer amidst the heavily saturated streamer population (are you good at games? Good personality? Good looking? Fulfill a niche role?). And then if you see an opportunity to collaborate, do so.  lilypichu: If her asks, certainly! lilypichu: Idk if I've ""made it"" but I still haven't stopped pursuing voice acting! That, and publish a children's book. :) lilypichu: D: Japanese..? Sushi is good. But Chinese has SO much variety. But I'm Korean...

D::: lilypichu: They play together so nicely! Her cat is a ragdoll :) Chi369: Hello Vinhtage please refer to this comment for what you're seeking :)

e4ll7bl,lilypichu,lily tries... knights chronicle (ÔΩ°‚óï‚Äø‚óïÔΩ°),"oppaniichan: For any gacha addicts out there, this is a pretty good one. It has all the features of a mobile anime rpg though quite polished. I'll give a relatively short overall review on the game as I've experienced it in the past 2 months. (rating system out of 5‚≠ê)


Gameplay ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê


&gt; Turn-based combat. Classic JRPG style~ If it's not your thing, you can stop reading here. Each hero has 3 skills, an innate passive, and a second passive achieved at max limit break. And of course, being a mobile game, there's stamina, 2x speed, and auto-play and auto-repeat mode for farming resources. 


Art/Animation ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê


&gt; Every character is rendered in 3d and each has their own 2d illustration and portrait. The art is A+ as far as anime-style mobile games go. The facial expressions are very clear, colors are vibrant, and the details of the heroes outfits are very clear (though comparatively simple to other games). IMO the design don't suffer too much from same face syndrome. Each hero has slightly different designs from 3* to 5*. The stage backgrounds are surprisingly nice ranging from places like the beach to a live concert. Overall nice on the eyes 


&gt; Each character is unique in their idle and attacking animations. Attacks have a bit of impact to them.  How they attack and their ultimate skill animations (skill 3) fit their theme and personality. From cool to cute to beautiful to edgy, they have it under wraps. The heroes grade doesn't really hurt the quality of what animation they have either. In fact, some of them are better than the SSR heroes'. From what I've seen in the hero codex however, all SR and SSRs have full ultimate animation cutscenes, while only few R heroes do.


Hero Roster (design) ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê


&gt; Good balance of husbandos and waifus. Most anime archetypes are filled. Some axe representation in the SSR field would be nice though.


Hero Roster (gameplay) ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê


&gt; The only hero you NEED in this game is Rue. After her, you can pull whoever you'd like and do fine in the early game. Most roles are filled in each element with tanks and supports being a bit sparse. In turn, they have really good value in this game and having most of the SSR supports is recommended. There are farmable SSRs (advent heroes, guild and arena coin) and guaranteed banner-featured SSRs upon spending 2k crystals. The endgame will be building top tier heroes from each element and enhancing them. 


Sound ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê


&gt; I play the game on mute most of the time since I watch streams or shows while farming. The bgm is mediocre. There are voiceover options for both Japanese and Korean. In Japanese, the voices mostly match the characters. It falls a bit short in the quality department though, with the voices sounding just a bit muffled. The UI effect sounds are above average, not sounding like a cheap Chinese mobage. 


UI (android) ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê


&gt; Smooth and quite responsive. The game supports landscape and portrait mode. Runes are a bit of a pain to sort through because you need to tap hold to review their substats for every single one. Like any new mobage, it takes time to get used to. 


Hero Rates ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê


&gt;SSR rate for banner heroes is 4.8%. It's possible to get a hero you want through tier spending (2k crystals) on a banner. I believe new players get 6 SSRs for their first week+ an SSR at the end of each week for their first month and an SSR Knight selector at the end of the month.


Multiplayer ‚≠ê‚≠ê


&gt; Overall it's somewhat laggy and your stamina could be used in better ways. If you want to multiplayer, it should be with friends/guildies or for an event.


Daily Grind (nearing endgame) ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê


&gt; A lot better than other games in the genre. What I like about the game the most, is it's not a huuuge daily time sink. Like other mobage though, you want to be play as often as possible to progress optimally however. Just off the top of my head, theres: daily quests (15~20min), guild dungeon (10 min), guild battles (10 min), boss dungeon (15 min), and daily dungeons (15 min). This all can be done on auto if you don't want to put any energy into it. Daily quests require 3 pvp matches which you can put a crappy unit to complete faster. 


&gt; Personally, I put about an hour and 30 minutes minimum each day. Most of it is auto farming while the rest is messing with runes or pvp battles.
 Cpt_Barricade: And what of your experience with the waifu and husbando factor? Do they live up to expectations set by other gacha greats like Granblue and Love Live Weeb Idol Project? oppaniichan: As far as anime fantasy designs go, KC hits the nail. Great to make fanart for. As characters themselves or being waifu/husbando material, they fall short due to the lack of content in the story department.

e232g89,lilypichu,sToRy TiMe !!‚ö†Ô∏è!! ITS LONG,"AwsomT: .    I had a dream that my parents and I moved to California. My uncle was called by LilyPichu to fix their AC because it wasn‚Äôt working. My uncle knew I was a fan of Lily, so he called me if I wanted to join. I accepted. We got to the front door and I knocked the door. Poki answered and let us in. I asked Poki where Lily‚Äôs room was and I went to her room as fast as I could.

.    I introduced myself and she asked me if I would want to join her singing class which was right then. I gladly said yes. After I practiced singing, I asked her if I could be in a video, she said sure. Then few minutes later, I asked her if I could be in a livestream, She took a few minutes to think about it, then she said, ‚ÄúWell... Your vocals are pretty good... (Okay, IRL my singing is really bad) Yeah you can be in my livestream.‚Äù (At this point this is where my dream stopped, but here an extended story)

.    The next day I got to the OfflineTV house and I was in the livestream. I promoted my YouTube channel. I would say, ‚ÄúWhile you‚Äôre watching Lily‚Äôs stream why not sub with Twitch Prime! It‚Äôs free! Just link your amazon account to twitch, and you have Twitch Prime! Also, who not consider subscribing to my YouTube channel?‚Äù As the day went on, I stayed at the OfflineTV house and got to know everyone.

.    I asked Poki if I could join OfflineTV, she said, ‚ÄúOnly for one day. We‚Äôll be streaming today, so you can pop in our stream and say hi.‚Äù I said okay and I asked if Lily was sleeping. I went to her room and while she was sleeping, I went on to her computer, then started streaming. I opened word then wrote a letter thanking her for letting me be in her livestream, Twitch chat helped me write the letter.

.    In the middle of writing the letter, she woke up and approached me. She said, ‚ÄúWut are u doing.‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm streaming making this thank you note for you.‚Äù Lily then said, ‚ÄúWell then, you shall continue, and I‚Äôll take over the stream later.‚Äù After some time, I finished the letter, Lily took over the stream, then I told Poki I was going home.

Also happy cake day! Ayasuna: Oh my. Didn't even notice, thank you Mr_ForTheNguyen: I'm not saying I actually know myself but she's always had videos with Jummy. They were good friends with each other before a bunch of friends and them moved into the same house and still are. Now that they're under the same roof, probably explains why you see Jummy more often (Although I don't see it. Seems pretty normal to me). Just friends being friends.

AmeliaAddis0605: Who is your favorite bts band member Casseerole: What do you feel about the current state of MMOs as someone who grew up on them? Are there any you're particularly interested in trying? CamilliaFlowers: If you weren't streaming and with offline tv, what would you be doing right now?  Mia0605: What would you say to someone who wants to start streaming but are to scared to put themselves out there and of drama?  Clean_Paper: What is your favorite meme of all time? FireSt0rm9: You ever plan on continuing you Dark Souls 3 playthrough? I loved watching that. üòÅ BlutigeBaumwolle: Any chance of a Nier Automata strim in the near future? Quasaru: Who are some of your favorite community artists and favorite fan art that you've enjoyed the most so far? Darkklaw: Hello! Please keep it to one question per person at a time! Xexanos: I remember that back in the day you rarely had a face cam in your streams and if you did you had some big sunglasses covering up your face.

What was it that made you overcome your shyness/insecurities? BlutigeBaumwolle: Oops. I removed one of them. Darkklaw: Thank you! Cpt_Barricade: if temmie could talk what voice would she have  iLuvwaffless: Hey Lily, as a long time viewer I really miss your piano compositions and I suppose this is more of a request rather than a question but would it be possible to upload some of your most recent songs up on youtube? (Meme things like joast theme song, destinys song, etc.) It seems that your youtube is mostly highlight from your stream but I think it would be great if we saw more music on there. Especially now that you can have albie collab with you. I really love when you two just jam out on stream and would love to have videos to listen to at will instead of having to hunt down vods. huyenlinh: who is your favourite influencer/content creator at the moment? (youtuber, streamer, VA, etc) Perpetualinvalidity: Hey!

The crisis line that I work for in MN is closing down. We used to handle all the mental health crisis and suicide line calls. I still really want to work in this area, so I'm thinking of starting a twitch channel based around playing some games and chatting with people who are going through some rough stuff, for support. What do you think of this idea? I would love opinions from others too. madforpeace: Hey Lily! I like your humor &amp; content! 
My question: who is your favorite youtuber?  Darkklaw: Since you would love opinions from others too:
It definitely sounds like an interesting idea, although it might attract a relatively niche audience and take a while to take off.

That said, I would suggest having a good look at the Twitch ToS. I don't know it in depth but I would not be surprised if some of the things in there might be relevant, even if only because of trolls this type of content might attract. Perpetualinvalidity: That is a very good idea. I also have my eyes on various HIPAA compliance and how that would work given that it's a public broadcast medium. louufy: What keeps you up at night?

If you're passionate about something, it will show. As for drama, that'll only really happen if you choose to involve yourself in such things OR you become big enough so that people make drama about you, in which case I'd consider that a win. lilypichu: nier is one of those games i keep saying i'll play soon but I keep holding off because I keep forgetting...

It's around here somewhere and it'd nice if you did because he's somewhat insecure about himself and while I think that's due to the hyperbolized aggression from his peers I also think that it's due him feeling that he isn't heard.

Was  just wondering because I just watched MagikarpUsedFly's old video about this and I know that there are streamers who dont like their stuff being put onto the said videos.

Also, JOAST is just a meme. spookyahoy: Do you ever miss home? BeekaChuuu: Hi lily I just wanted to say hi and that a lot of people have mistaken me for you in a lot of games that have voice chat in!

I feel like it's pretty common for people at the top of their field to feel a desire to move on to some kind of new challenge. It's pretty safe to say you've ""made it"" as a content creator, so do you ever get the urge to move on from what you're doing now and fully devote yourself to some other field?

It sounds like a very stressful, but rewarding, endeavor.  lilypichu: old nana is pretty cool. red hair gets me.  lilypichu: might as well while i'm relatively young :'\_) lilypichu: not sure, but we'll see. there might be other plans coming up! lilypichu: i really wanna do a sayaka + violin boy cosplay with albert :D lilypichu: kana hanazawa lilypichu: 5 years ago lily: no wai why would ppl watch me LOL  
3 years ago lily: so ur telling me i have to break up now?

XD lilypichu: depends on my schedule. 1 AM to 4 AM.  lilypichu: I guess anime :( lilypichu: Eh I don't rly care anymore as long as they don't monetize.  lilypichu: Yes! I love starbucks... I just bought my own starbucks cup and make my own coffee now lol lilypichu: Yep! Thought it was slow in some parts but overall not t e r r i b l e ... lilypichu: Decent tech setup (audio, cam, computer). Ask yourself what you have to offer amidst the heavily saturated streamer population (are you good at games? Good personality? Good looking? Fulfill a niche role?). And then if you see an opportunity to collaborate, do so.  lilypichu: If her asks, certainly! lilypichu: Idk if I've ""made it"" but I still haven't stopped pursuing voice acting! That, and publish a children's book. :) lilypichu: D: Japanese..? Sushi is good. But Chinese has SO much variety. But I'm Korean...

D::: lilypichu: They play together so nicely! Her cat is a ragdoll :) Chi369: Hello Vinhtage please refer to this comment for what you're seeking :)

7cpqqn,lilypichu,Regarding memes and friendship,"Xarixas: Hi, technically all of this is just out of curiosity and is actually is none of my business. Wanna start by saying that i don't follow lily and destiny by a long time, so i don't know how they were\if they were so different before. What actually confuse me is why some of the fan base of lilypichu depict her like this kinda of ""pure innocent child"". I mean, wasn't she famous for some of her songs like ""i'd like to teach the world to fap"" and for her ""savage comments""? Also... why people say ""she is not kind and loving"" and things like that just because she likes to banter and be edgy? I mean, as i say don't follow her by a long, but when pokimane was sick, she made her soup. Isn't this actually what a ""caring and loving"" person do? Ffs, a lot of you watch anime\read manga and literally most of shonen protagonist are rude edgelords but that actually, in the deep, are kind and loving. Also, just saying, what we saw online is just a part of the personality of someone. Especially if they are streamers.
