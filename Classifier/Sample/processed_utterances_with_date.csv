46,e47bbku,NinjasHyper,Ninja’s reaction to article posted about playing with female gaming streamers,"Admiral_Bob: He's states multiple times that the reason he doesn't want to stream with females is the fear of harassments aimed towards his wife, which is a totally acceptable fear.  We recently saw this with myth fans coming out in the hundreds and harassing fedmyster in a pokimane stream chat when they were streaming together.  And ninjas fan base is much bigger than myths.   Saint__14: I mean, honestly, how could anyone expect him to cross streams with girls. They don't even pee standing up! Crowgora_: That is one way to look at it. But what if, now hear me out, that female streamer knew the risk and still wanted to take that risk? Ninja has a huge audience and knows he can impact 0 peoples careers. 

His first response to this whole mess should have been, ""I do not want to bring negativity to 0 channels or harassment"" not, I will not play with female streamers. His first statement makes it look like his relationship is not stable, and in general, he/her both struggle with fidelity issues. 

I can respect the second statement, but it is very reactionary.  McBoregano: It's his relationship and personal business and the amount of entitlement from these female streamers is amazing. No one *deserves* a chance to stream with him. If he doesn't want to he shouldn't be obligated to. Why is this even a discussion? Crowgora_: Oh, i do agree. But, there are different ways to answer the question that the lead to that answer. The way he answers provokes drama, articles, and people questioning his intentions.

Like, is he so worried that his wife might miscons1 every action on stream? He could have just said that he would play with any streamer if the opportunity arises and left it at that.

Im not a ninja fan, but i like his stort and journey so far. I find it interesting seeing him develop and grow his brand.

But he needs a pr guy at some point. McBoregano: His wife is his PR guy. So, uh I wouldn't want to deal with rumours about my partner even if it weren't 1. It doesn't matter how strong their relationship is. People calling it fragile are way out of line.

Tl;Dr: Let Tyler Blevins live his blooming’ life, mate.



Two years ago, while volunteering for a charity medical center, my dad was accused of trying to “be involved with” a woman volunteering there as well (he definitely wasn’t, she had previous accounts of anxiety that had manifested in that way.) The claims were groundless, and my m0 was hurt, not by my father, who has always done his utmost to be clear and faithful, but by the allegations levied against him. Had this been a couple working to get their relationship right, or had my father been less trustworthy or my m0 been less trusting, this would have damaged their relationship permanently. He left, and only recently returned since his accusers left. People seem to forget the nature of tabloids, rumors, and lies. Honest people, in honest relationships, are damaged and their relationships damaged/destroyed by falsifications raised against them. 

And the internet is no different. When Ninja speaks to the reality of clickbait, he isn’t speaking from a place of dead, but from a place of experience. Shock value and the best story is supposed to inevitably bring the most success, and what better story than bringing down the number 1 streamer? Regardless of anyone’s opinion about ninja, his level of success in the gaming medium makes him a target to those who would take advantage of the juiciest story. To say people won’t sell the news in a way that disrespects his life choices and love for his wife, are ignorant of the way the news/media/world works. I, personally, don’t see sexism in Ninja’s actions, because the decision he’s making is not merely to preserve his career, but to preserve the honor of the woman he loves. I don’t know this for sure, but given the flak he’s gotten for this, that he KNOWS he would have gotten for this, I’m fairly certain he is willing to give up a majority of his successes if it means his relationship with his wife remains healthily intact. 

I always reserve the right to be wrong. No one is perfect, especially on the internet, but if we want him to change his actions, the Twitch/Youtube community needs to move away from sensationalizing the personal lives of our entertainers the way previous generations have. It’s not his responsibility to fix the internet. It’s his responsibility to do right by his wife, though. Antroh: He really doesn't have much to worry about. Any self respecting woman watching him do that gay little dance would have nothing to do with him chezzinationstation7: To each their own on preference, which is how people should approach his decision, rather than put the full weight of twitch culture on his shoulders.",chezzinationstation7,"Long post, regarding the controversy around the Polygon article.

Only reason there should be a problem with him playing with girls is if he doesn’t trust himself or Jess doesn’t trust him. 
Regardless, pussy whipped.  DOERAYMEME: This comment is so meaningless. Who are you to say what is or isn’t a problem for ninja. There might not be a problem at all. It’s just he wants to respect and protect his marriage relationship more than the average. I think that’s noble and respectable, and honestly, more men should have this approach. 

The fact that people are angry shows how little character they have and they are taking up a SJW banner for no fucking reason whatsoever 0 than to join in the anger on social media. 

Any reasonable person would read that article in its entirety and understand his perspective, whether or not they agree or disagree. 

I’ll never understand how trying to protect your relationship with your wife is “pussy whipped”.

You don't find these tweets reasonable at all? You can't see where they're coming from? SmurfBearPig: I can see where they are coming from but i can also think that their arguments are flawed and Ninja also has a point.

From Ninja's point of view this has nothing to do with the LGBTQ community. His wife is probably very comfortable with his sexuality and knows to ignore outlandish rumors about him.

What Ninja is only trying to prevent unnecessary harassment on his wife every time he streams with an0 woman ( something he knows for a fact will happen because of the size of his audience).

The whole ""Trigerred feminists"" image we get is due to the way some websites reported on this and how comment sections/ twitter reacted. The handful of rational people bringing good points like the 2 you linked won't change the public opinion when there's a whole mob of people trying to throw him under the bus for protecting his marriage.

TlDR: Ninja expressed himself poorly but has a point, left wing media goes on to prove his point by trying to start a controversy out of this. vertical_suplex: 
he can do whatever he wants, and if he chooses to respect his wife's wishes and not stream with women, then fine that's his/their decision. It's a free world, and you have free will, a bunch of feminists and liberals have no say in how you feel, think or act.

403,ddd7ibb,Angory_Tom,Cities Skylines - Mid City Meteor Strike - Part #34,"Rad_Carrot: Poor Tom, although that meteor strike really could have been worse.  Ever seen the film Deep Impact? Don't, it's awful.

I was away for a week so I've been catching up on videos.  Having just watched the last one with the, uh, ""updated"" metro system, I have to say, wow, that is certainly a metro system.  A metro system that was built.  Yup.

I'm also not sure who told Tom that bus lines shouldn't loop, but I'm guessing they're still giggling.  Bus lines absolutely should loop, they just shouldn't have too many stops.  Bus, metro and tram lines should also ideally have a 'reversed' line, a second line that mirrors the first but goes in the opposite direction.  The game allocates the appropriate amount of vehicles to a line automatically based on the usage, but Tom is using a mod that should make this work more efficiently and that he can override as necessary - so he doesn't absolutely need that reversed line, but it can still be a smart thing to add.  

Adding a second reversed line also mean cims can move across the city better.  Imagine a circular bus line with twelve stops, like a clock.  If the bus line only goes clockwise, a person who wants to travel from stop 6 to stop 3 has to go past 8 stops before getting off.  If there were a reversed (anti-clockwise) line, with the opposite bus stop across the road, they only need to go past 2 stops on this line.

I hope Tom does revisit public transport in the future, if only to bring back *Nightbus* and give us an0 montage of his descent into madness. CountyMcCounterson: It would be better if the surprise wasn't ruined by the title ZeNightmare1001: I love Tom's attitude. it's always a bit of nonchalance mixed in with everything that makes him so magical and, well, Angory!

408,dbyrkyz,Angory_Tom,Astroneer - ANOMALIES - Part #3,"ragedogg69: Since he asked at the end of the video here are my thoughts on the editing:

I prefer more editing.  It does not have to be North Side High levels of editing.  I know this will mean shorter or less frequent videos, but youtube is full of low effort lets plays.  What drew me to Tom is his editing.  I know minutes watched is the big deal on youtube now, but I think all these youtubers that throw a low effort ""completes"" series for easy minute viewed is not the answer.

Stand out Tom. ptatoface: Tom, I don't know if you've been made aware of this since recording, but the tethers are a crucial part of the game that you're missing out on. To use them, all you have to do is put them in your inventory (not in the special slot that you put solar panels in) and press T to place them. Place the first one close enough to the base that you see a blue ""oxygen wire"" connected to it from the base. Then, you can connect a second tether to the first, a third to the second, and so on until you have a chain of them. If they're all connected, they should provide with oxygen (and energy if your base has it) in the same way that your base does. Basically, it means that you can explore for more than 20 seconds before having to run back to base for oxygen.

Also, when you get energy in item form by sucking up enough of the yellow crystals, it acts like a non-rechargable battery. You can plug it into anywhere you can put solar panels for quick energy.

On the question of editing, I think that it isn't really needed very much when playing multiplayer, and can be cut down a bit in singleplayer. For example, I personally wouldn't mind that much if you didn't do the thing where you show a picture of something whenever you say it, like trains in the recent Cities: Skylines episodes. mr_mallen: I'm probably echoing most peoples comments on youtube and reddit - prefer the highly editted because it sets tom apart but both styles are welcome. 
An0 thing i'm really liking is that tom is working hard to make his viewers a part of his channel. I hope he keeps this going as his channel grows.

418,9oeb64,Angory_Tom,Has Tom and Co considered playing Kings of War with their old Warhammer:Fantasy model collections?,"hallgeir: So after coming back to Warhammer Fantasy after a long (15 year) break and finding it dead, I began looking for a replacement.  AOS felt too half-blizzard/half WH40k.  I was intrigued by Ninth Age, and also considered maybe just eBaying the 8th ed rules and so forth.  I also found an0 game: Kings of War.  Kings of War is is a fantasy rank and flank game by Mantic very much int he spiritual style of WH:FB.

&amp;#x200B;

It was long considered a Warhammer-lite, but since the collapse of GW's Warhammer:FB, it has really risen into popularity (So I am to believe, i Dont get out enough to determine it's actual popularity).  Mantic really went above and beyond to ensure the Old World Refugees had a place to play, and have rules written for every one of WH:FB's proxy armies and units. Mantic even allows a large percentage of old GW figures in their official tournaments since they don't have model lines for all armies, e.g. Ratkin/Skaven.  

&amp;#x200B;

The rules are far more simplified than WH:FB were but that may be a good thing.  When I was watching the VOD for one of the recent WH:TW II streams, Ben mentioned the ""One-page Warhammer"" rules and how they actually allowed for deeper tactical game-play by cutting a lot of the fat, KoW is similar to that.  I also hear that, via this simplicity and an earnest desire, there is decent army balance. This is appears backed up by the large tournament scene KoW seems to have. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am a bit surprised that I have not heard them mention this in a stream, either derogatorily or 0wise, given it supposed popularity and similarity to the old Warhammer. I would love for them to consider it, or at least look into it, and I would LOVE to see some Rank and Flank games with their old collected armies on Tom &amp; Battle Boys vids.  

&amp;#x200B;

Have you heard of KoW? What did you think?  Do you think Tom and Co would be at all interested?

https://store.steampowered.com/app/720250/Welcome_to_the_Game_II/ ( the gameplay is a mix of browsing websites on the internet but you are able to move around it’s a sequel to an0 game but this one is superior )


https://store.steampowered.com/app/323720/Decay_The_Mare/  (a point and click game )


https://store.steampowered.com/app/577080/A_Dump_in_the_Dark/ ( a very bizarre game maybe you will like it )


https://store.steampowered.com/app/733800/Frosty_Nights/ ( a sort of five nights of Freddy’s game set at Christmas) SuicideByDragon_1: Megaquarium, Parkitecht but with an Aquarium, the sandbox mode is brilliant in how flexible it is.

An0 game for tom to keep an eye on Godhood, god game about creating and spreading your own religion. Shrimpton: I thought Tom might enjoy the spooky, point and click/hidden object detective style games that artifex mundi makes.

Enigmatis: The ghosts of Maple Creek is probably my favourite of theirs, not to mention it has 2 sequels. atilaa: Transference. It's one of those creepy walking sims he likes. It's made by Ubisoft alongside Spectervision, Elijah Wood's film production company and it's a really great game, fantastic sense of creepiness all throughout the game. It is roughly 2 hours long as well so it won't take that long to finish. would love to see tom's reactions to it, and i think he would enjoy it quite a bit.

Transference also has none of those run and hide from monsters sequences he hates as well. It says it works with VR but its fantastic without it as well

It's a bit old but very entertaining game. charlesh4: You and Simon should do the Rusty Lake games gonnakillu2: I know Tom seems to like to do shorts, but since he's been doing longer let's plays, why not let him try ""Observer""?

I think tom may enjoy it, it's a bit like subnautica in space Purzzle: I would love to watch you and Simon play ""Dr. Langeskov, The Tiger, and The Terribly Cursed Emerald: A Whirlwind Heist"".

It's a short, humorous walking simulator. It should be perfect for one video (max 30 min).

<url> supremegeneralj: A few horror game suggestions for Angory Tom to play on his channel.

<url> ( the gameplay is a mix of browsing websites on the internet but you are able to move around it’s a sequel to an0 game but this one is superior )


<url>  (a point and click game )


<url> ( a very bizarre game maybe you will like it )


<url> ( a sort of five nights of Freddy’s game set at Christmas) SuicideByDragon_1: Megaquarium, Parkitecht but with an Aquarium, the sandbox mode is brilliant in how flexible it is.

An0 game for tom to keep an eye on Godhood, god game about creating and spreading your own religion. Shrimpton: I thought Tom might enjoy the spooky, point and click/hidden object detective style games that artifex mundi makes.

TomtheCheeseFarmer: You're welcome, I think he only set it up today and he hasn't said anything yet about when he intends to start streaming but hopefully it will be pretty soon! connorockz: So glad! Love to see Tom on twitch! MainaC: Just please don't go the way of Sips. I can't lose them both. jimbobsmells: Ditto. Tom’s youtube channel has been a more than worthy replacement for Sips. It would be terrible to lose him to twitch too.  Palpadean: If Tom switches from YouTube to ONLY streaming via Twitch then that's probably the end of watching the Yogs on the regular for me. I work, I simply don't have the time to watch hours and hours of streaming.

On an0 note since you mentioned Sips, he was the first channel I subbed to and he brought me into most of what I like now but I unsubbed from his YouTube after he returned to playing Skyrim only to find out he had just cut down what he streamed. No fun editing like before, just more of an almost expressionless face in the bottom corner having conversations I can only hear half of. I utterly detest Twitch streams. I can't get involved in chat if I don't subscribe half the time and I can't follow the chat and pay attention to the video game at the same time. It also doesn't help when Sips is still hundreds of episodes into games like The Witcher which I have zero interest in but he can't be b0ed to play anything else. 

The Chilluminati streams are almost the exception as you get four guys in a room talking to each 0 most of the time and not interacting with the 0 people on chat whom, no offence to you guys, are not the reason I started watching the Yogscast in the first place.

I get it. I honestly understand why YouTubers are moving over to Twitch because Google is slowing making YouTube total dogshit that doesn't support the creators as much as it once did, but surely there is a compromise here somewhere. Why can't we have both streams and YouTube series? Why does it have to be one thing or an0? I really feel like if I pop on YouTube it'll be to watch someone else with a ""channel update"" about how they are moving to Twitch and I have to simply find something else.

- Happiness buildings for industry

- A decent water supply not based on water towers

- Lower Taxes (taxes have actually slowly been going up)

- Fill in the empty areas along the roads

We've seen a lot of 3D horror lately and I was thinking it would be fun to have some old school pixel horror on the channel to switch it up a bit.

First I highly recommend The Charnel House Trilogy. Super creepy atmosphere with a lot of sweet literary references. Not so many jumpscares but unsettling atmosphere and genuine spooks for Halloween.

Second: Lone Survivor. Creepy and has monsters. Silent Hill style atmosphere. Little bit of surrealism.

Last there's a heap of RPG maker horror that is actually A+++ content - Mad Father,  Corpse Party, Ib, The Witches House, Ao Oni, Forest of Drizzling Rain, The God of the Crawling Eyes.... All that good stuff.

So, do you guys have any adventure horror? Pixel horror? 2D Horror? What are your Halloween recommendations? abbiedabbiedo94: Hotel remorse its only a little game but its good and will give Simon a scare",Kthulhu42,"Hi there Angory folks

You can see that series with proper story arcs, like Hat Films' Rust series, get more views and this series felt like it had arc. I'll admit now that it feels like it's petering out, the jokes don't come as thickly and I suspect that Tom's stringing himself along at certain points. Or rather I know that I always reach a point in Cities Skylines where I build things only because ""well I guess that should be there"".

My suggestion wouldn't be to say ""50 episodes and that's all folks"", I'd say push it up to say 60, cos I don't don't think Tom's stunning work pace can take us to an appropriate end in that time. At least that's how I expect. I would also say that he should finish up the riverside industrial zone and then take a break for a while, and think specifically on how to finish up the rest of the riverside (for completions sake), and THEN in the last episodes of the series plan out and make Tech Island SUPER FANCY and packed with loads of details and special buildings (giant skyscrapers ofc).

Then end the series I say, give it a clear end goal with lots of effort in the end and cut it before it drags on. If Tom can give this series a proper, well-defined, and memorable ending then it'll be one of the best series in Yogscast history. darthmorf: How about natural disasters to finish it off?  TommyAtkins_: Clearly it should end with Tom, satisfied and relieved with Strictoaster levels of Cities: Skylines detail and care, gazing out at the whole city...

BUT THEN IT'S GONNA FLOOD. LIKE NIAGRA FALLS.

Giant eruption of water placed in Poo Lagoon. Incredibly bad acting by Tom pretending he didn't do it in cut footage.

And maybe some meteors before it cuts to black...

A few moments of darkness and then all you can hear is the faint laughing of the King of Poo Lagoon. He appears faintly to taunt Tom one last time...

End video. Move aside Shadow of Israphel here's the most cinematic series around.

Maybe that would be fun? Like a sort of ""end cutscene"", depends on how far Tom would go for it but it would be hilarious stupid if the flooding was interspersed with greenscreened yogscast at eye-level views, screaming about the flood.

If anything Tom should use it as an opportunity to really experiment, and try something you wouldn't normally do in a video.

So er, I guess the answer to your question is... yes :) connorockz: Personally, I believe it is time. Let's get some 0 amazing games!  Zethniti: If Tom thinks it's time, then sure. I'd like it to go on forever myself, but that's just the Angor-addiction speaking.

Also, I've been asked to be the GM for a roleplaying game set in Nowhere City (though it will always be called Tomtown in my heart) in a couple of weeks, so I'm always thirsty for more of that amazing, crazy lore. mattym9287: I'd pretty much watch it forever but if Tom thinks it's time to move on, he needs to. Hopefully to some 0 management style game, the pace really works with the way he plays it.  darthmorf: That sounds amazing RG1527: Tom + Rimworld = awesomeness Afreeusernameihope: I hear what everyone else is saying. 

But this is currently the only Yogs series - is Tom 1 Yogs yet? - that i actually wait for, and saying a new video uploaded genuinely excites me! 

I don't think an0 9 episodes is quite enough, but all things have to end. 

So I agree with what someone else said, Tom should give it a short break plan what else he wants to do with the city and then finish it off, properly!

Armour is generally not worth it*, especially in the yellow tree. It has diminishing returns past 100, so heroes with high and low armour benefit more from the % heath increases. However melee attack and defence are the best choices to start with for almost every hero in the yellow tree. Charge bonuses can be very good on a mounted lord, but you need to cycle charge the lord for it to really be worth it. Melee attack and defence are just great at both beating down 0 heroes and protecting your hero mans from the attacks of the fodder.

The red line is generally considered better for lords as it buffs your army, and legendary lords in particular tend to have unique skills in the top bar and the red branch that buff certain units - like Morgar's super-spawn or Volkmar's Ultra-Flagellants. It is however not as fun as having hitty-mc-hit-face basically solo an entire army.

Blue line is also good, extra movement is really good, as is Lightning Strike. The horde armies also tend to have Horde Growth on their lords in the first set of blues, which is dull but almost always the first pick for a lot of people as it means you can sack more stuff, get more loot and recruit more mans.

There's no absolutely best single path, it depends on the hero and the race. Generally hitty heroes want to be more hitty and supporty heroes want more buffs. Races like Chaos and Vampires excel at making their lords champions of combat, whereas Empire generally want to stick to army buffs as their lords just don't match up to the beatsticks of Chaos/Vampires.


*It's better on the Wood Elf heroes because they buffed the amounts on a bunch of things Angor_is_Angory: DO you want the fighty spawn or the defendo spawn? Zeratill: Toootally missed you'd replied!Probably too late but personally I like/went for the attacking spawn, I used about 8 of them as my line infantry later in the game and made sure I had some bestigors around to tie up any anti-large units (like halberdiers) and just charged the fuck out of anyone who came near me with cavalry and cygor support to deal with the flanks. Spawn are much more hitty than they are defendy, so generally you want to kill them before they can kill you as an approach. IIRC Morghur has a top row skill to give them missile resistance or a ward save though, which is an excellent pick because the main drawback of Spawn is how vulnerable they are to missile fire, especially from asshole Empire armies with a billion crossbowmans. So the resistance one from the top row, and the melee attack for spawn and monstrous infantry from the red row.",Zeratill,"Skills advice for Tom and Ben

580,der0q9x,Angory_Tom,Should Cities: Skylines end and ep 50?,"darthmorf: Tom has said in the latest Cities: Skylines (Episode 41) that he is thinking of finishing the series at episode 50. I was wondering what your opinions were, so I've created a straw poll: 
http://www.strawpoll.me/12497391/

I personally would like to see the continuation of the series, but I do understand if Tom wants to mix it up. Perhaps it could work if there is more of a mix of different content being uploaded? I think it could be nice at least to see Tom have a go at the new Mass Transport dlc coming out soon, after the *spectacle* that is the rest of the public transport system...  darthmorf: [Poll results so far](http://www.strawpoll.me/12497391/r) EmperorJake: Whenever Tom does decide to end it, I'd like to see it replaced by an0 building game series - I'm sure Prison Architect would be fun, or maybe Factorio TommyAtkins_: For sure it shouldn't go on too long, this is a problem that absolutely plagues every series in the yogscast, dragging on without a clear end then just being forgotten about very suddenly. For me at least it makes series like DirtQuest and Druidz unwatchable because I know there's no pay-off to it all.

You can see that series with proper story arcs, like Hat Films' Rust series, get more views and this series felt like it had arc. I'll admit now that it feels like it's petering out, the jokes don't come as thickly and I suspect that Tom's stringing himself along at certain points. Or rather I know that I always reach a point in Cities Skylines where I build things only because ""well I guess that should be there"".

My suggestion wouldn't be to say ""50 episodes and that's all folks"", I'd say push it up to say 60, cos I don't don't think Tom's stunning work pace can take us to an appropriate end in that time. At least that's how I expect. I would also say that he should finish up the riverside industrial zone and then take a break for a while, and think specifically on how to finish up the rest of the riverside (for completions sake), and THEN in the last episodes of the series plan out and make Tech Island SUPER FANCY and packed with loads of details and special buildings (giant skyscrapers ofc).

Then end the series I say, give it a clear end goal with lots of effort in the end and cut it before it drags on. If Tom can give this series a proper, well-defined, and memorable ending then it'll be one of the best series in Yogscast history. darthmorf: How about natural disasters to finish it off?  TommyAtkins_: Clearly it should end with Tom, satisfied and relieved with Strictoaster levels of Cities: Skylines detail and care, gazing out at the whole city...

BUT THEN IT'S GONNA FLOOD. LIKE NIAGRA FALLS.

Giant eruption of water placed in Poo Lagoon. Incredibly bad acting by Tom pretending he didn't do it in cut footage.

And maybe some meteors before it cuts to black...

A few moments of darkness and then all you can hear is the faint laughing of the King of Poo Lagoon. He appears faintly to taunt Tom one last time...

End video. Move aside Shadow of Israphel here's the most cinematic series around.

Maybe that would be fun? Like a sort of ""end cutscene"", depends on how far Tom would go for it but it would be hilarious stupid if the flooding was interspersed with greenscreened yogscast at eye-level views, screaming about the flood.

If anything Tom should use it as an opportunity to really experiment, and try something you wouldn't normally do in a video.

So er, I guess the answer to your question is... yes :) connorockz: Personally, I believe it is time. Let's get some 0 amazing games!  Zethniti: If Tom thinks it's time, then sure. I'd like it to go on forever myself, but that's just the Angor-addiction speaking.

Also, I've been asked to be the GM for a roleplaying game set in Nowhere City (though it will always be called Tomtown in my heart) in a couple of weeks, so I'm always thirsty for more of that amazing, crazy lore. mattym9287: I'd pretty much watch it forever but if Tom thinks it's time to move on, he needs to. Hopefully to some 0 management style game, the pace really works with the way he plays it.  darthmorf: That sounds amazing RG1527: Tom + Rimworld = awesomeness Afreeusernameihope: I hear what everyone else is saying. 

But this is currently the only Yogs series - is Tom 1 Yogs yet? - that i actually wait for, and saying a new video uploaded genuinely excites me! 

I don't think an0 9 episodes is quite enough, but all things have to end. 

So I agree with what someone else said, Tom should give it a short break plan what else he wants to do with the city and then finish it off, properly!

I'm mainly looking for entertainment value or spookiness, and I thought Bonbon was pretty decent at that.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway it's definitely up to me to decide in the end since some videos aren't for everyone. I was just wondering if there's a series you guys would suggest watching."" - end of the quote.",,0.8199806809425354,1541022551

&amp;nbsp;

Here are the full lyrics to this song. I feel like this song, especially the hook, need a little more context than my 0s. Basically this song touches on the summers spent in my small town, jumping between present day, high school, and my youth. The ""that's my shit, fuckin your bitch"" part isn't so much a brag as it is the sad truth of the mindset I was in during high school; I got drunk and lost my virginity to a friend's girlfriend, who years later committed suicide. I also talk about how an0 friend got me into drinking, drugs and rapping, and how that friend also passed away. There's a lot of emotion in this song to me, but I can easily see how it can be viewed as very cliche and boring on a surface level. 

Also the title ""Medium"" is a double meaning: the first one being that I wore medium sized shirts in high school and I now wear large, and the second one being that a medium is someone who can communicate with the dead.

Thank you for listening, I can't wait to show you guys more song very soon.

That's my shit

Fuckin your bitch and I'm
Fuckin your bitch

This the best summer I ever had
I went to heaven no coming back
I hit the gym with a duffle bag, duffle bag
I hit ya girl with a ruffle bag, ruffle bag

Chips chips chips 
All on my lips lips lips
Xoxo kiss kiss
Xoxo gossip, jakey in a bitch

I put my state on the map like this
 (What that shit sound like) SD
Me and my dick and his two best friends
(Run it back run it back) testes 

I got the power to pull up
And hop out and pop out
And puke on the 
pave-ment

Fuck all the money I'm saving
Man - I didn't even know

I could talk to the 
dead like this
Like this 
Like this, fuck it up

(Hook x2)

I do this shit for my dead friends
Me and my br0 we brethren
He the one that got me rappin 
Captain and coke in the basket

I'm not 21 so I'm askin
I'm not 21 I aint savage
I ain't tragic, I know magic
Leviosaa, my package (leviosaaaa) 

The first girl I did it with 
Killed herself
So now I gotta make sure
I know myself

But I'm fine (ok)
It's fine (ok)
Had a BFF online (ok)
Hit up MSN all night (ok)
Gotta be kind rewind (ok)

But then I got DVDs
And then I got HDDs
But I'm still young Jakey
Sucked in by TV screens

I'm playin DKC
I'm playin Kirby's Dream
I'm living out my dreams
I'm living everything (music is my life!)

Imma do everything I can 
steal out of the house 
of my soul, snackin on 
graham cracker cereal bowls 

Say what you want 
cause ya boy on a roll 
Say what you want 
cause ya boy eatin rolls

Say what you want 
you can say what you want
But you know that you wrong
When I bare out my soul

Lower the beat 
in the burial hole
Bury me too cause 
I didn't even know

619,dpnyrkm,NakeyJakey,Concern for the Patreon,"baprahamian: TL;DR: I’m worried about donating to the patreon when Jakey is not sure what he wants to do with the channel and how to use the patreon to make it better. 

I am a current patron for Jakey and I am starting to wonder if I should continue to support him this way. If you’re reading this, please don’t take it the wrong way Jakey. I am I huge fan. I love all your content, including your videos, songs and even your fucking snapchats. The reason I am considering to stop supporting the patreon is because it seems like you don’t really have a direction for the channel. At least in past videos you’ve stated the channel doesn’t really have a direction and it’s more of a side project to your music career/video career/game developer career?/whatever it is you end up doing. This on top of things like seeing you go to pax, buying a new camera, and just recently visiting New York makes me wonder if my money is actually going towards content on the channel. We get a video a week if we’re lucky and I feel that right now your channel doesn’t seem like an investment I should make. To end this I want to say that I love you more than anything Jakey and I will be a hot boy to my grave. I just hope for a clear look at a bright future for the channel, as opposed to a “hey we’ll see how it goes!” Again, I really respect Jakey for making great content and pursuing his passion. I’m just trying to be a smart investor.  Psynergy: He said on twitter that he had a video for this week about Super Mario Odyssey, but didn't like how it turned out, but he has big things coming.

My guess would be dunkey made him think twice about posting his vid, which sucks but is understandable  Brissot: It's a valid point for sure. I'm not a Patron but bought a tshirt, if that counts, but still think more content is needed though! But I still trust in Jakey so I don't care too much.

Real talk tho, he would be perfect for that podcast. Definitely would make for a great episode, and he absolutely deserves the notoriety.

Also, he needs to get on Guest Grumps. Even beyond him being an Egoraptor fan, he would fit into that show super well. They should play some Halo 3 split screen and rap at each 0 or some shit. That would be tight. Stecyk: Papa Bless, that would be so great!  The episode where they brought on Dunkey and Leah has so far been my favorite by a very wide margin, but I think an episode with Jakey would give it a very good run for its money!  Just the concept is a strong contender for the best episode!   lyoooooooon: i have a youtube friend that is friends with him, maybe i can ask without sounding scummy Alex2life: Hope not. Woulf love to have him on 0 podcasts but H3... Fuck no.

Dont want him near that right-wing enabling garbage bin.

This comes from a long time fan of theirs too. I unsubbed after they had JonTron on the podcast and honestly just ignored all the extreme and racist stuff he said previously.

Real talk tho, he would be perfect for that podcast. Definitely would make for a great episode, and he absolutely deserves the notoriety.

Also, he needs to get on Guest Grumps. Even beyond him being an Egoraptor fan, he would fit into that show super well. They should play some Halo 3 split screen and rap at each 0 or some shit. That would be tight. Stecyk: Papa Bless, that would be so great!  The episode where they brought on Dunkey and Leah has so far been my favorite by a very wide margin, but I think an episode with Jakey would give it a very good run for its money!  Just the concept is a strong contender for the best episode!   lyoooooooon: i have a youtube friend that is friends with him, maybe i can ask without sounding scummy Alex2life: Hope not. Woulf love to have him on 0 podcasts but H3... Fuck no.

Dont want him near that right-wing enabling garbage bin.

This comes from a long time fan of theirs too. I unsubbed after they had JonTron on the podcast and honestly just ignored all the extreme and racist stuff he said previously.

Edit: that isn't good  Snortz69: AKA Wiener dude! CALEBthehun: What do you mean?

Asking out of ignorance not confrontation  ObsidianJones: I belong to a select few people who believe that h3h3 was more or less ruined by reddit and their blind fanaticism and cult mentality.

Not that being popular is the reason for their decline in quality, I think it's the speed. When you have humble people like Ethan and Hila, or Jakey for that matter, blowing up can do some serious damage. It can fuck with your humility, it can go to your head, it can make you hyper sensitive to your content and needs of your fans, and often time all of those things at once.

Jakey seems like a normal, humble, well adjusted person who wouldn't let these things go to his head, but it happens to nearly everyone. I remember when I thought h3h3s quality wouldn't wane, because of their down to earth attitude, but look at them now. In my opinion, I was an idiot to think that.  CALEBthehun: Thanks.

ObsidianJones: Yeah man, me too. At the end of the day no one is in charge of their fans. I think iDubbz gets away with his popularity by his blatant disregard for what his fans want. 

When one cares too much for their audience, it makes the transition into sellout unnoticeable, and very smooth, where the choice to sell out isn't even a decision made by Jakey, or H3, it's made by the exterior culture surrounding them.

I hate that Jakey pushed the the whole agenda that Valve doesn't make games and doesn't care about gamers anymore. Let me explain why.

Valve still makes games. They run and maintain two of the biggest esports titles in the world (Dota 2 and cs:go). Keeping these two games running takes a tramendous amount of effort. And it's not for nothing, they are making literally millions of gamers happy. AAlso, dismissing Artifact basically as just 'lol card game, I don't care' is unreasonably reductive, imo. Card games have a huge player base. Card games can be enjoyed by non-gamers and by cuthroat competitive gamers alike.

If you're a fan of story driven singleplayer games then yes, you're probably not a fan of Valve's recent titles. But if you're a fan of competitive pvp multiplayer games then you gotta love Valve.

It is a matter of preference, I get it. I just think its dishonest saying 'Valve doesn't make games anymore.' I hear this repeated all the time on reddit and it pisses me off. Valve just fell in love with competitive gaming, so they're making games in that genre. And that's ok. spacejam_onbluray: old enough to know better  spacejam_onbluray: i feel like his attention isn't on the quantity of the games being produced, but the quality and direction the company is going

like, yes, DOTA2 and CS:GO are e-sports staples, and they are both very polished; they take all the elements from their previous iterations and refine them, and the only purchasable items in the games are strictly cosmetic. admittedly, i'm not a very avid fan of either of them, but i still acknowledge that they are very well-made, and if a friend asks me to play either of them with them, i don't hesitate. i will admit though, they feel less like sequels and more like massively remastered/overhauled versions of their predecessors

there is one thing, however, that some of their 0 franchises (Half-life, Portal, Team Fortress, Etc.) possess that CS and DOTA do not; spirit and personality. TF2 is vibrant and full of characterization and humor, Portal has it's complex gameplay, Half-life has it's (at the time) innovative physics and immersive atmosphere... you get it.  you've probably heard this shit a thousand times though

hell, if you count all the games that valve has made? 11 of them are singleplayer/have a primary singleplayer campaign/whatever. they have made, in comparison, 24 games. this is also counting small stuff like the HL:Source remake, and HL: Lost Coast.

valve isn't known for single-player experiences, they're known for their unique stylizations and design. i honestly don't know how to word it but Valve's iconic games all share a specific **feel.** some of the newer releases just don't have that feel.

... and also Artifact just looks like ass to me so far. it looks uninspired as all hell, which... it kinda is, derived off of DOTA and all.

would love to hear y'alls opinions though! i didnt factcheck this shit at all so lemme know if i missed something everythings_alright: i dont see whats wrong with dota 2 and csgo not being sequels, but remasters. thats what the fans of the games wanted and judging by their success, i would call it a good move by valve.

PM_ME_YOUR_EYEBROWS_: I mean he said Bioshock Infinite was ass and I liked it a little bit so idk? spacejam_onbluray: yeah, i always disagree with the whole ""riding back in your Mom's Honda Accord"" and ""my friend ricky's dad has Back to the Future on VHS"" and ""sony playstation video console"" bit

mostly because i wasn't fucking alive around those times but they seemed pretty sweet CcaseyC: Infinite is dope . CcaseyC: Lolol how old are you? derekwboxer: While I realize this isn't quite the popular opinion, I did actually somewhat enjoy the campaign of GTA V. everythings_alright: The Valve video. I hate that Jakey pushed the the whole agenda that Valve doesn't make games and doesn't care about gamers anymore. Let me explain why.

Valve still makes games. They run and maintain two of the biggest esports titles in the world (Dota 2 and cs:go). Keeping these two games running takes a tramendous amount of effort. And it's not for nothing, they are making literally millions of gamers happy. AAlso, dismissing Artifact basically as just 'lol card game, I don't care' is unreasonably reductive, imo. Card games have a huge player base. Card games can be enjoyed by non-gamers and by cuthroat competitive gamers alike.

If you're a fan of story driven singleplayer games then yes, you're probably not a fan of Valve's recent titles. But if you're a fan of competitive pvp multiplayer games then you gotta love Valve.

It is a matter of preference, I get it. I just think its dishonest saying 'Valve doesn't make games anymore.' I hear this repeated all the time on reddit and it pisses me off. Valve just fell in love with competitive gaming, so they're making games in that genre. And that's ok. spacejam_onbluray: old enough to know better  spacejam_onbluray: i feel like his attention isn't on the quantity of the games being produced, but the quality and direction the company is going

like, yes, DOTA2 and CS:GO are e-sports staples, and they are both very polished; they take all the elements from their previous iterations and refine them, and the only purchasable items in the games are strictly cosmetic. admittedly, i'm not a very avid fan of either of them, but i still acknowledge that they are very well-made, and if a friend asks me to play either of them with them, i don't hesitate. i will admit though, they feel less like sequels and more like massively remastered/overhauled versions of their predecessors

there is one thing, however, that some of their 0 franchises (Half-life, Portal, Team Fortress, Etc.) possess that CS and DOTA do not; spirit and personality. TF2 is vibrant and full of characterization and humor, Portal has it's complex gameplay, Half-life has it's (at the time) innovative physics and immersive atmosphere... you get it.  you've probably heard this shit a thousand times though

hell, if you count all the games that valve has made? 11 of them are singleplayer/have a primary singleplayer campaign/whatever. they have made, in comparison, 24 games. this is also counting small stuff like the HL:Source remake, and HL: Lost Coast.

valve isn't known for single-player experiences, they're known for their unique stylizations and design. i honestly don't know how to word it but Valve's iconic games all share a specific **feel.** some of the newer releases just don't have that feel.

... and also Artifact just looks like ass to me so far. it looks uninspired as all hell, which... it kinda is, derived off of DOTA and all.

would love to hear y'alls opinions though! i didnt factcheck this shit at all so lemme know if i missed something everythings_alright: i dont see whats wrong with dota 2 and csgo not being sequels, but remasters. thats what the fans of the games wanted and judging by their success, i would call it a good move by valve.

and yes, they do feel different, because theyre like that by design. the games want to be optimized for competitive playing and they accomplish what they set out to do.",BoffoGolby,Personally I never have he seems to be one of the few youtubers I have yet to disagree with.,0,19,9,0,0,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",0,,0,"The quote: ""BoffoGolby: Personally I never have he seems to be one of the few youtubers I have yet to disagree with.

CcaseyC: Lolol how old are you? derekwboxer: While I realize this isn't quite the popular opinion, I did actually somewhat enjoy the campaign of GTA V. everythings_alright: The Valve video. I hate that Jakey pushed the the whole agenda that Valve doesn't make games and doesn't care about gamers anymore. Let me explain why.

Valve still makes games. They run and maintain two of the biggest esports titles in the world (Dota 2 and cs:go). Keeping these two games running takes a tramendous amount of effort. And it's not for nothing, they are making literally millions of gamers happy. AAlso, dismissing Artifact basically as just 'lol card game, I don't care' is unreasonably reductive, imo. Card games have a huge player base. Card games can be enjoyed by non-gamers and by cuthroat competitive gamers alike.

If you're a fan of story driven singleplayer games then yes, you're probably not a fan of Valve's recent titles. But if you're a fan of competitive pvp multiplayer games then you gotta love Valve.

It is a matter of preference, I get it. I just think its dishonest saying 'Valve doesn't make games anymore.' I hear this repeated all the time on reddit and it pisses me off. Valve just fell in love with competitive gaming, so they're making games in that genre. And that's ok. spacejam_onbluray: old enough to know better  spacejam_onbluray: i feel like his attention isn't on the quantity of the games being produced, but the quality and direction the company is going

like, yes, DOTA2 and CS:GO are e-sports staples, and they are both very polished; they take all the elements from their previous iterations and refine them, and the only purchasable items in the games are strictly cosmetic. admittedly, i'm not a very avid fan of either of them, but i still acknowledge that they are very well-made, and if a friend asks me to play either of them with them, i don't hesitate. i will admit though, they feel less like sequels and more like massively remastered/overhauled versions of their predecessors

there is one thing, however, that some of their 0 franchises (Half-life, Portal, Team Fortress, Etc.) possess that CS and DOTA do not; spirit and personality. TF2 is vibrant and full of characterization and humor, Portal has it's complex gameplay, Half-life has it's (at the time) innovative physics and immersive atmosphere... you get it.  you've probably heard this shit a thousand times though

hell, if you count all the games that valve has made? 11 of them are singleplayer/have a primary singleplayer campaign/whatever. they have made, in comparison, 24 games. this is also counting small stuff like the HL:Source remake, and HL: Lost Coast.

valve isn't known for single-player experiences, they're known for their unique stylizations and design. i honestly don't know how to word it but Valve's iconic games all share a specific **feel.** some of the newer releases just don't have that feel.

... and also Artifact just looks like ass to me so far. it looks uninspired as all hell, which... it kinda is, derived off of DOTA and all.

would love to hear y'alls opinions though! i didnt factcheck this shit at all so lemme know if i missed something everythings_alright: i dont see whats wrong with dota 2 and csgo not being sequels, but remasters. thats what the fans of the games wanted and judging by their success, i would call it a good move by valve.

and yes, they do feel different, because theyre like that by design. the games want to be optimized for competitive playing and they accomplish what they set out to do."" - end of the quote.",,0.8024317622184753,1537669561

You could do this with many games but if Matt and Trey Also helped on the project, It could be a better story then the Smash Bros Brawl Story Mode.

Jakey is Eric, the hyper ADHD one, and Jacob is Hannibal, the calm one who represents the audience. It's like comedy genius right there  CALEBthehun: I don't think this guy is funny though. If he is, it's not shining in this video. Hannibal is definitely the bit of sanity in Eric's show, but I felt like in this video Jake was an annoying distraction from what I normally like in Jakeys videos : Jakey breaking something down and making me laugh while doing it. Sometimes thought provoking, always entertaining.

This was just a shameless plug on his merchandising while introducing a flat character to be the good cop to his bad cop. It leaves something to be desired. 

Whatever. Yall can shit on me for the blasphemy of having an opinion against a Jakey on his subreddit. That's how I feel and I'm not sorry. 

 friktionmonkey: Not shitting on you, just giving my opinion. I feel like it's a pretty well thought out parody of the current state of YouTube  Agrees_withyou: You're absolutely correct! friktionmonkey: I needed you today  JMAN_JUSTICE: Watch a Logan Paul vid and then rewatch jakey’s “vlog” you’ll see it’s a parody of what has now become the standard of modern day vlogging. That standard being from non-stop plugging of merch, which if you watch vloggers today it’s actually quite comical( [Jake Paul - All I Want For Christmas](https://youtu.be/LvYbhJ6pryA) ), to their overtly energetic “everything is awesome” behavior. 

His friend plays as a parody of the modern day vlogger’s friend. Videos where vloggers roll around with a posse have these friends. They’re their yes man, they laugh at the vloggers every single joke, and they would literally kiss the vlogger’s ass if he asked them to. In this video jakey’s friend was not that usual vlogger’s friend, but a normal guy. Someone who would get annoyed and call him out on the stupid shit he does in the video which is something that wouldn’t happen in a modern day vlog. I loved his role in this video, because in the real world you’d expect the vlogger’s friend to call them out on their stupid shit or say “dude that’s not a prank” but in reality that never happens. 

And that’s why I believe his friend is actually the main subject in this video. If he didn’t call Jake out on his outlandish behavior then it wouldn’t be a parody anymore. Because that’s just how vlogs are these days.

I’m sorry for the long post, but this is just to explain what modern day vlogs have become and how this was a parody of them. I really enjoyed this video because my girlfriend watches a lot of vloggers, which l leads me to watch a lot of vlogs...and I fucking hate them all.

I am a current patron for Jakey and I am starting to wonder if I should continue to support him this way. If you’re reading this, please don’t take it the wrong way Jakey. I am I huge fan. I love all your content, including your videos, songs and even your fucking snapchats. The reason I am considering to stop supporting the patreon is because it seems like you don’t really have a direction for the channel. At least in past videos you’ve stated the channel doesn’t really have a direction and it’s more of a side project to your music career/video career/game developer career?/whatever it is you end up doing. This on top of things like seeing you go to pax, buying a new camera, and just recently visiting New York makes me wonder if my money is actually going towards content on the channel. We get a video a week if we’re lucky and I feel that right now your channel doesn’t seem like an investment I should make. To end this I want to say that I love you more than anything Jakey and I will be a hot boy to my grave. I just hope for a clear look at a bright future for the channel, as opposed to a “hey we’ll see how it goes!” Again, I really respect Jakey for making great content and pursuing his passion. I’m just trying to be a smart investor.  Psynergy: He said on twitter that he had a video for this week about Super Mario Odyssey, but didn't like how it turned out, but he has big things coming.

My guess would be dunkey made him think twice about posting his vid, which sucks but is understandable  Brissot: It's a valid point for sure.

If you have a cool image relating to one of my videos ( say a funny piglet wang picture or something random) share it here for people to see! If you want discuss something I said in a video or have a conversation about a game im playing go ahead and post that here aswell.

Ill be posting all my videos here when they come out so this is an0 place to have video discussions. I actually prefer reddit just because its much easier for me to read and respond to stuff.

With the announcement of this subreddit, we’ve noticed a influx of posts that are based around wanting to show Imane a video or posts that requests a response from her. To keep /r/Pokimane spam free and to make it easier on Imane, we’ve decided to start a Megathread. This is a feature that will be re-posted every Monday.

-------------

You can leave any questions or comments here that you’d like responded to by pokimane.
We want everyone to enjoy the quality of this subreddit while following a few rules:

 *1. No NSFW/rude comments or questions

*2. Do not spam the megathread, edit your comment if you’d like to add more to your questions

*3. Be as concise and specific as you can, it’ll ensure your question will be answered as thoroughly as possible.
 
**Please note that all subreddit [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pokimane/wiki/rules) still apply**

-------
**To help prioritize questions since not every single one can be answered (though she will try), follow the guidelines below:**

*1 Upvote/downvote any questions that you want Imane to pay special attention to (Please note that the rules above still apply, questions about Imane’s personal life might not be answered)

*2 If there are questions that you know the answer to, help save some time by answering them if you can 

 **Any questions about the subreddit itself should be directed to our [modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FPokimane&amp;subject=&amp;message=)** r2swag2: As much as the shipping has been resisted, which has been your favourite? 

Are there any plans to be more EU friendly?  Quasaru: Do you plan on playing VRChat or some 0 variety game soon I like the VRChat streams they are unique. Also it'd be cool to see you more active on your own discord and the OfflineTV one if possible! I think it would be funny if you submitted art in Lily's art class whenever her next one is! Ad2not82: I'm new around these here parts. What times do you stream? Is there a set time or is just whenever you feel you should? TeepEU: She doesn't really have a schedule, pretty much whenever she wants. Ad2not82: Okay, cool. Thanks dude ihasagi2urdicc: can you accept me in your discord my name is Blade Giraffies: If you have a question about her discord server, please contact the discord’s moderators.  TeepEU: In case you were looking for the discord link ~ https://discord.gg/VS4gzt MarvelousMaverickk: Poki, what are the top traits you look for in a person you may possibly have a long term serious relationship with? I ask you this because it let's us know you better as a person. I personally look for 1. High level of Self-esteem 2. High level of self-confidence 3. Highly Intelligent 4. VERY Romantic 5. Has a good sense of humor 6. Has a Big Heart. 7. Loves long passionate kissing. Well that is my list. How about yours. By the way, I'm just asking you this to just get more of an insight into your personality, that's all. We would love to hear it. Thanks Poki, I appreciate it. MurlocMan007: Do you like elephants?

1057,e1hztgo,Pokimane,Dr. Poki Question,"DiamondDM13: Howdy, I just found the Dr. Poki video with Toast in it, got directed there from a couple of Toast videos, and it was quite a fun segment to watch. I'm not particularly interested in League of Legends, but I would like to watch more of the Dr. Poki segments, if this is an actual thing Poki does regularly.

So my question is, is there some kind of place where I can check out the Dr. Poki segments that have taken place? Is there a playlist or something similar I can use for it?

Thanks. beastaa1: From my knowledge the best place is her you tube channel,and you could also use her twitch past broadcasts DiamondDM13: Yeah, that was how I watched the Toast and Co. one, had to find out which was the Past Broadcast (well, clothing helps). Was hoping there was some sort of listing of past segments that I could use to at least see what to look for in the past broadcasts... Does she do these with any frequency? beastaa1: From what I remember there isn't any schedule for Dr poki ,they're not too far apart though,I think its every Friday I might be wrong but I recommend you tune in and check her live streams out,also her twitter can be very helpful too,hope I been a help to you (: DiamondDM13: Oh yeah, hopefully she announces it on Twitter, that would be good. Thank you. beastaa1: There's also ways you can talk to her and ask her yourself,like let her know your questions,concerns,wants wether via dono, tweet etc. She's really into that whole feedback from her community thing,I don't recommend you be annoying about it though DiamondDM13: Yeah I guess I can try that as well, drop her a message or something. Although it is not particularly feedback from the community. I'm not interested in League and such, and it seems her community does enjoy that, while what I find fun is something interesting and unique like the Dr. Poki segment. I assume her community backlash if she were to focus more on what I personally feel is more interesting.

Don't worry, if she has the possibility to answer, good, if not, I don't see a point in b0ing any further. beastaa1: Okie dokie,I believe she welcomes all feedback of every part of her content creation,fyi her community enjoys everything she does especially IRL stuff like Dr poki,asmr,vlogs,poki podcast etc.,probably even more than her actual gaming content,she's just that amazing of a person,you'll see and good luck😊 DiamondDM13: Well, that is cool then, games like League are not my thing, but she does seem to have a cool personality, which would help as it would be far more interesting to focus on that. Thank you. beastaa1: Yeah she does have a awesome personality but she plays 0 games too like fortnite,me personally, I watch her a little bit more for who she is,but she's really good at games so I do learn from her,i believe all her content is fun and entertaining,anyways your welcome my friend,anytime,I'm glad I could help,peace out😅",beastaa1,"From what I remember there isn't any schedule for Dr poki ,they're not too far apart though,I think its every Friday I might be wrong but I recommend you tune in and check her live streams out,also her twitter can be very helpful too,hope I been a help to you (:",1,1,9,0,0,0,,0,,0,"The quote: ""DiamondDM13: Howdy, I just found the Dr. Poki video with Toast in it, got directed there from a couple of Toast videos, and it was quite a fun segment to watch.

I try to have every element of the track contribute to that feeling. This is the reason why I chose the whispering vocals of poki over a generic rap acapella. They just work better...

The rematch was already in the contract so tying wasn't going to guarantee anything for a second match, both of them were utterly confused with the result each thinking they were going to win and both kind of frustrated with it. So they either became great actors while exhausted or that was totally unexpected. And they weren't going to bleed with head gear on unless one of them took a shot to the nose directly.

 And from my understanding and scoring of it Logan won early KSI won late for a 3-3 tie. Had it been seven rounds there'd be a winner but clearly they wanted that to be in play to some degree both knowing that if they fought for seven rounds exhaustion would defeat the loser more than the 0 fighter.  splrltz: why are u talking about staged u stupid fuck when you fake your reactions.. there is a video of you legit insta locking draven to troll tyler1 and pretend to act as if u didn't know wat u was doin Carltxn: Finally a fucking good answer on Reddit, holy shit, this was hard to find.

2º If you guys want to relax on chair do it but bring the mic closer. I'm pretty sure moving the mic doesn't produce any sound that should be bad to the quality. And you don't need to talk louder, just bring the mic closer.

3º Since you guys are sitting in a straight table with everyone looking to their sides to look at each 0, sometimes stereo audio seems a bit weird and lower the volume. At some point more audio was coming from the right then the left. I saw someone at chat complain about that too. Maybe force the mics to be mono, but I don't know if this affects quality.

4º Also, if it was possible to people look at each 0 from the 0 side of the table, just like h3h3 podcast is, it would be AWESOME. And also fix 3º.

5º Not using fixed topics, or trying to stick to the topic, was cool to the conversations be more cool and the flow was good too, but sometimes it divert too much. Even though I enjoy the story behind twitch and yours careers, maybe more topics outside twitch would be cool.

Just my 2 cents, this podcast was awesome and I expect more awesomeness. thanks for reading 

~~Sorry for the poor english D:~~ LuKSTaR: My constructive criticism goes to Fed and Poki which is to try to limit the use of saying 'like' too frequently. Its fine to use as a filler word every so often but I feel especially with Fed its way too excessive to the point of it being distracting. Being able to speak more concise goes a long way to keeping your audience engaged, even if you have to pause before you can continue!

1139,dsrkzlu,Pokimane,Many Reasons Why Pokimane Is A Very Good Streamer,"MarvelousMaverickk: I have seen many many streamers on Twitch but NOBODY like Poki. Here's are My Reasons why:

Poki makes an effort to be Super Nice to everyone on her stream. Think about how hard that is.

Poki ALWAYS thanks each every subscriber and donator on her stream.

Poki makes a good effort to entertain and be funny as much as she can. She is very expressive and animated in the way she talks and in the way she shows her emotion. 
 
When she is in a good mood and feeling great there is no one who has a better smile than her. She has a One Million Dollar Smile when she is happy. 

Now, let's state the obvious. She has a very cute face and to put it very simply it can be quite disarming. 

I noticed after being on her stream for awhile that she has very strong morals. I think that is good. A moral person is a good person.

She is very aware that there are A LOT of younger people on her stream and she makes an effort to keep her stream PG. That's important. Good for her. (I know she may speak  the odd foul word, but hey, no one is perfect, lol)

She's a good communicator because she knows how to use her voice tone and body expression to get her points across. (She may not be aware of this, but I have noticed it)

If you have watched Poki on her  stream for at least a little while you would definitely conclude that she wouldn't hurt a fly. Certainly, not on purpose. I know she's not perfect, but she is a good person.
 
She is the most ENTHUSIASTIC streamer I have ever seen. She is not always in the mood but I think she is pretty consistent and tries to be in a good mood for her viewers and it shows in her enthusiasm.

So, yeah, there it is. I enjoy 0 streamers on Twitch as well, many of them, but Poki has that rare combination of being Super Nice, smart, and entertaining all at the same time.

After people started talking more, it became imperceptible.

2º If you guys want to relax on chair do it but bring the mic closer. I'm pretty sure moving the mic doesn't produce any sound that should be bad to the quality. And you don't need to talk louder, just bring the mic closer.

3º Since you guys are sitting in a straight table with everyone looking to their sides to look at each 0, sometimes stereo audio seems a bit weird and lower the volume. At some point more audio was coming from the right then the left. I saw someone at chat complain about that too. Maybe force the mics to be mono, but I don't know if this affects quality.

4º Also, if it was possible to people look at each 0 from the 0 side of the table, just like h3h3 podcast is, it would be AWESOME. And also fix 3º.

5º Not using fixed topics, or trying to stick to the topic, was cool to the conversations be more cool and the flow was good too, but sometimes it divert too much. Even though I enjoy the story behind twitch and yours careers, maybe more topics outside twitch would be cool.

Just my 2 cents, this podcast was awesome and I expect more awesomeness. thanks for reading 

~~Sorry for the poor english D:~~ LuKSTaR: My constructive criticism goes to Fed and Poki which is to try to limit the use of saying 'like' too frequently. Its fine to use as a filler word every so often but I feel especially with Fed its way too excessive to the point of it being distracting.

1165,e5y82z7,Pokimane,Poki nowadays compared to the past (League of Legends times),"JohnLeffers: Hello people,   


i used to watch Poki when she streamed League of Legends,  accordingly her following base was lower than today´s. Which wasn´t bad, because she was way more of an personality than she is today, at least in my point of view. I understand that streaming could get less enjoyable with the time, especially when you kind of have to entertain and maintain the large viewership. Don´t get me wrong, iam not here to hate, she´s still a great streamer/player and helps so many people with really bad problems, but when iam watching her nowadays she seems kind of boring compared to the past. Today most of the time she is singing quietly and isnt really speaking to the chat while playing Fortnite. When she duos with a random or for example Cizzorz there isnt much conversation from her side and if it does it feels a little like a awkward smalltalk. I just posted this, because i want to know if iam the only one who feels like this. I still watch her from time to time, but it kind of feels a bit cringy compared to the old times. I want to point out, that this isn´t meant as hate, i just want to clarify if 0 people feel the same way as i do.  


Thanks JohnLeffers: thanks for the interaction lads  human_nature_: Yeah I feel you here 100%, I sometimes wish she’d go back to streaming league but hey whatever  LimonadeSenpai: I agree with you. I almost never watch her stream since she started playing fotnite BagelsAndJewce: This isn't super surprising. Her audience has drastically changed in the past few months and so has the game. League is one of almost pure isolation unless you duo with someone. You just grind away while fortnite is almost the complete opposite. It reduces down time and encourages playing with 0 people. Combine that with the fact that her audience is bigger and of course shes not going to interact with chat more or the same as before. It's just a different dynamic. She still does sit around and talk to stream at the beginning and end of streams so it's still there just that the main course is different.  theblacksmithz: You talk about her being pretty quiet, but it’s obviously really difficult to be constantly talking for 3 hours per stream, 3 or 4 days per week for however many years she’s been going. The reality is talking for extended periods of time is really unnatural, and most people struggle to do it for even one minute. So I think it’s justified for her to be quiet/singing song lyrics or whatever in silences, and I think if she talked constantly it’d be the most annoying shit ever XD. If you watch one of Ninja’s, he’s quiet most of the time, much more than Poki, but that’s probz cuz he streams everyday for so long.",human_nature_,"Yeah I feel you here 100%, I sometimes wish she’d go back to streaming league but hey whatever ",1,8,7,1,1,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",0,,0,"The quote: ""JohnLeffers: Hello people,

Why don't they just institute a no cleavage rule or something. I'm all about tits, and I'm all about gaming, but Twitch is supposed to be a community for the common interest of gaming. There are already plenty of outlets sl00ts like them can use to con guys out of money [Which is insane you would pay for anything even closely resembling a naked woman in 2017 with the amount of free porn there is] Are users upset about this flood of camgirls?

Sure some female streamers may elect to use (ahem) physical assets to appeal to their target audience. It has no bearing on 0 channels or what you have to watch.

Twitch could certainly improve how it implements their policy on these types of shows across genders, but that is a different conversation.

There's also an ongoing issue verifying age on the internet to access content that is not policed or falls within looser guidelines.

I watch a lot of Twitch and some boobs on streams that I'm not watching literally has no bearing on my entertainment.

Umm in terms of discrimination I have no clue what you mean honestly. Are you saying some streamers will feel pressured if 0 streamers are allowed to show cleavage?

WAKE UP SHEEPLE TWITCH IS STEALING YER HIGHGROUND Orngog: I think firstly twitch needs to redefine themselves as what they want to be. If that means losing the kids or the honeyz, so be it. I personally would be surprised to find they could come up with a sellable catch-all. 

But yes, that's assuming they sincerely care about the age of their viewers.  FishHack: i guess boobs are offensive. or maybe you just don't watch her or her stream. oh well.
 ShutterBun: They should just go ahead and show porn on ESPN,  because adult channels exist. ShutterBun: Supppse Twitch degrades to the point where it becomes 95% cam girls, and gaming streamers find that they can no longer afford to stream, so they fold up their tents and go get jobs.

Then Twitch becomes just an0 porn site.  Would that affect your viewing? rumblebe3: Is Twitch folding a result of a tidal wave of cam-girls? Are they using too much bandwidth and overloading the servers?

If Twitch degrades to a point that only 5% of the current gaming community remains then yes that would affect my viewing, regardless of cam-girl status.

&gt; fold up their tents and go get jobs

Don't mean to alarm you but many people make a living streaming through Twitch and 0 sites. Companies and entire industries are leveraging this platform in a financially viable way. I believe that constitutes a job. rumblebe3: Except that that's not what's happening here. Your e-sports stream isn't being attacked by a flurry of breasts, there is a separate channel that has them. 

It certainly isn't promoted content. iplayinthedark: Mmm you're slow. Twitch is ESPN, the e-sports stream is Sports Center.  iplayinthedark: Go do some homework on the topic and come back.  rumblebe3: Then the whole analogy breaks because the whole point is that you can change channels. Twitch is an entertainment service in the same way the your TV is more than an ESPN box. You can watch whatever the hell you want.

To play ball though: If one Sports Center segment shows lingerie football it does not invalidate the existence, or your enjoyment, of Nascar. rumblebe3: They are a streaming platform. Their grounding is in the video game community and they recognise that is their primary offering. 

That being said if you want to stream your pet doing tricks you absolutely can. The onus is on content creators to find where there is demand. 

Hopefully they can establish a working and enforceable code of conduct that doesn't just conform to dated TV standards.

GTAman51: Can you help me understand why are you here if you're not a fan?  tenkini: Can you help me understand how to type? :( Blindobb: Because I find it fascinating that someone like this hasn't been banned considering her blatant sexualisation as a core part of her content, revealing clothing, and low effort streams, and still seems to have a really dedicated fanbase regardless of whether she has any talent or not and is based on looks alone.  I think it's a really good question you have though and I don't have a real answer for you.

It comes down to me not thinking her content is really appropriate for Twitch and I feel like she is taking advantage of the kind of userbase Twitch has which is impressionable guys.

So I answered your question now can you answer mine?

Blindobb: I mean Twitch is primarily a place for video game streaming and he’s actually good at video games. That along with his incredibly high effort streams with professional graphic design and an incredibly deep streamlab overlay, he has an original character that he created and doesn’t just spout dead memes and dance for subs or donations, which is pathetic and really close to being a modest stripper by the way, is probably why he pulls in 10 times the amount of viewers amouranth has. If you are going to try to compare streams he isn’t a good one to pick. Say what you want about his personal life or who he is as a person but the quality and effort put into his stream is indisputable. People may not like him but my girlfriend doesn’t like Breaking Bad but that doesn’t mean it’s a bad show. It means she is a tasteless bitch.  vegandawg: Well we'll have to agree to disagree there. I personally find an attractive girl with a super hero body to be more ""art"" than some douchebag trying to ironically look like a 80's metal personality and playing boring video games. She does more than dance around and recently does stuff with an asmr mic. There's no accounting for taste afterall though. Personally I love breaking bad as well and my wife hates it too. Don't watch amouranth much (probably watch world of tanks streamers more than her) but hard to dismiss her as a ""modest stripper"". Do you think the same of say STPeach?

1396,dqkyvae,Amouranth,Amouranth is Supergirl,"lost_in_technicolor: So are these her supposed “NSFW lewds”? God she’s pathetic. 

I mean, she’s obviously talented at making costumes, and arts and crafts. But her content on Twitch and YouTube is incredibly cringeworthy and vapid. The most irritating thing about her is her attitude about it. She streams with her tits and her ass hanging out ALL the time, then she acts like she’s legit and makes YouTube videos like “OMG someone offered me $3000 for sex! Can you believe it?! Ugh! I’m just a nerdy comic book nerd and gamer!”

Why hasn’t she been banned from Twitch yet? 0 people have been banned for stupid mistakes, or just bending over once...

I dunno. It’s just EVERY TIME I get on Twitch and go to IRL, there she is at the top of the page. It’s like she streams 12 hours a day just laying around or dancing.  D3vil_0: Well you're just not getting it then, Twitches band or because she hasn't done anything wrong and if you're up upset with her Bob's and butt sticking out then keep your eyes closed dummy and change the channel. lost_in_technicolor: Boobs and ass don’t “upset” me, but there are 0 places for that. Twitch is a streaming site for people to interact with chat while they do interesting things (video games, art, music, etc.). Now, I said Amouranth is indeed talented at crafting cosplay and going to conventions. The 0 shit? She is so cringey at how she takes advantage of horny teenagers. “Squats for subs”? Come on... it’s ridiculously obvious, and I’ve seen 0 streamers get banned for much less blatant behavior. 

And, FYI, yes I go into Amouranth streams every so often because she’s ALWAYS at the top of the IRL page (for obvious reasons) and I am curious to see what new gimmick she has going on to sucker people out of their money. She rarely seems interested in chat. She’s always “playing” that dancing “game” which is just an excuse to bounce her T&amp;A around. Come on, man. When you get a little older you’ll realize how empty and exploitive her “content” is. 

I know several people that work their asses off putting together entertaining streams. They’re constantly talking with chat. It sucks that a lot of people aren’t seen because people just see Amouranth at the top of the IRL page and go watch her. Sex sells, and that’s all she’s doing when she’s not actually working on cosplay.  blackldr: I thought someone said she does actual lewds. Seriously this is,her best?

I checked her twitter and a post that had absolutely nothing to do with twitch or her ban had a person on there calling her a cunt and telling her they hope she get pema banned or something like that.
  
There's no way all the hate she is getting is because of her many *accidental* slips, the internet if full of nude people of all kinds.

1439,4gqe7q,legendarylea,"The content of twitch streams - ""Gameplay"" vs. ""0"" which do you prefer?","Lookitsa3headedmonky: Im curious, for all of the people who dislike the ""non gameplay"" part of Leas stream - which streams do you like?

Where is the border between ""gameplay"" and ""0""?

Could ""0"" be equivalent to ""entertainment""?

Do you also dislike tv which is not documentaries or the news?

Im puzzled - I don't understand why people dislike the non-gaming content on twitch. Also - basically every channel has content which is not related to gameplay at all. So is it only bad if it involves good-looking women? What if a famous streamer like say - Day9 talked about non-gaming content. Would that upset you aswell? 

For the record, he does that - quite a lot, 50% of his stream is about pussies. mhselif: First of all the ""non gameplay content"" is to much of an open statement many types of non gameplay content exist.

First you have non gameplay content streams where they watch youtube videos, look at reddit or just browse things on the internet. This should be moved to gaming talk shows after 30 minutes based on what I hear is twitch policy.

Second there is non gameplay content that is csgo gambling on websites which is not part of the game and not gameplay. This is kind of a grey area right now, but I've heard rumors that twitch is coming down with some new rules regarding gambling on these websites possibly having to move to a different section

Thirdly this is the non gameplay content that people have a problem with, the non gameplay content where someone is sitting in full screen acting like a fucking tool majority of girls that do this clearly using this time to exploit there body for some gain or publicity. This is the shit that should be banned and regarding for lea her non gaming content usually involves an ""accident"" of her showing her ass so yea that's why hers is a problem. If she wanted to have non gameplay content and conduct herself in an appropriate manner then it'd be okay. But she is a drunken slob when this happens and to be perfectly honest its trashy as fuck to watch her drunk slurring her words. Shes a fucking grown ass women not a teenage party girl she needs to grow the fuck up.

And for day9 he should move to gaming talk shows. Soda at the start of most streams spend like 30 minutes to an hour reading donations resubs watching videos people link him but as far as I remember he doesn't sit in full screen cam showing off his body and I believe he actually sets himself under gaming talk show.

For me personally if people like soda,summit,tim spend an hour of there stream non gaming content by all means go ahead. Ever notice how the majority of girls the second the game ends or they go do something they instantly go fullscreen for as long as possible till the next game? If a guy did it id have the same problem but majority of the time guys dont sit full cam for that long and if they do they are not bending over showing there ass or making sure there cleavage is in the camera frame.

 adyboss8: It's as simple as: if it's not gameplay it shouldn't be on twitch. There is no further argument. If you want to just fuck around you can go on YouNow or sites like that. If you want to use your sexuality for money you should go on Chatturbate or 0 sites like that. I can't see what the problem is here. Lookitsa3headedmonky: What I understand from your post is:


* youtube or ""browsing things on the internet"" should be moved to gaming talkshows. But is OK on twitch


Why is this? I don't see the logic behind this? How is browsing reddit or watching youtbube a gaming talkshow? It's just someone looking at the internet. It's as far away from gaming as it can possibly be.


* gambling is a grey area - likely to be moved to a different section.


Gambling is a part of many games, i.e. CSGO and Hearthstone, where is the logic behind claiming it is not gameplay related content?


* People have problems with non-gameplay content that involves behavior they as viewers do not agree with. (i.e. drunk streams, teenagers/slobs). 


Why are drunk streams not gameplay related content? I play games when Im drunk. So do many streamers, its fun. I don't see the logic: If someone is drunk, their gameplay is not gameplay? what?


* Using physical appearance is not an ok way to attract viewers.


This I don't understand - are we only allowed ugly streamers? Should webcams not even be allowed? Why can people not look good on stream?
Does this also apply if people use their personality to attract their audience? i.e. if someone is using jokes or humor to attract viewers. Is that fair to people who are not funny?

Do you see where this is going? In the end - if we apply all of these rules, we end up with a set of rules that are so strict, that you cannot possibly comment on anything or show your picture without someone taking offense, and claiming the contents are inappropriate.


* nudity is not okay

These are typical things in USA where the usage of psyco-anti-depression medication is off the chart. lealover2028: God, I really hope retards like you get a grip at some point. DyrusKaiba: it's bc of stupid idiots like you that Lea (and 0 camwhores) exists, and Lea has HUGE money, and her life is amazing, while yours is a shit.
I like laugh at your fucking miserable life lol lealover2028: I havent paid a cent to lea...and you are the imbosile commenting on 0 peoples comments on a thread that has nothing to do with you. If you dont like it then how did you make it to this thread about lea? Oh thats right because you are a loser that probably does this on every streamers reddit.

Also: at some point in life you kind of have to learn how to feel good about yourself without being dressed skimpy. I'm a man too, women are hot, I get it, and it's nice to be reassured.

But damn until then she needs help..... idotechstuff: I don't buy all this shit from her. She claims having anxiety from choosing what to wear because of the slips and previous bans when she showed more than she should and like she is being targeted because of that.

1) The blatant camgirling and accidents have stopped. She doesn't drink liquor anymore or act like a whore for donations. She still wears mini-skirts and goes full cam to put donors flags on the wall but I think almost every female does a variation of that.


2) Her looks have quickly deteriorated. She looks like a 40 something crackhead who caked on a pound of makeup on her face. Alcoholism and pill popping ages you rather quickly. Outside of her legs/body, she has zero redeeming qualities.


3) She barely streams anymore. She used to stream for a good 1/3 of the day but now she does these 3 hour boring sessions and logs out because she genuinely thinks some people are there to see her gameplay.

You don't like it, don't watch her stream. Or label the fucking streams (may contain more than 17% human skin visible, zomg!1)

Despite that, Twitch's stance on this is just plain stupid (as are most american media corps'); showing slaughter, beheadings, guts, exploding bodies - all fine. But don't show a nipple or everybody goes batshit crazy.

Not only that but she makes mad bank. She has an entire army of failed strippers/cam girls under her for ""Team Kitty"". The amount of white knights in her channel are fucking disgusting. At least Lea plays... attempts to play games. Girls like Kitty need to be on Hitbox with Brittany Venti.

BUT: if you try to become part of a culture by playing the ""look at me, I'm hot""-card, there's dangers involved. The internet is a nasty place and there are lots of 0 ways to get viewers.

Also: at some point in life you kind of have to learn how to feel good about yourself without being dressed skimpy. I'm a man too, women are hot, I get it, and it's nice to be reassured. But it's pretty worthless if you feel huge and fat just because you're wearing a t-shirt... aegisz: hahahhahaha karma is a mdfker isn't it Lea. Lookitsa3headedmonky: ""She brought it on herself?""

You built it you dumb fuck.

But that doesn't change the fact that Lea played this very user base to it's fullest extend and that she tried to take advantage of that. If you're gonna build your success on reassuring horny, sexist teenagers that you're basically nothing more than a piece of meat two blocks away from chaturbate, you probably should have been way more secure about yourself. Lordsokka: She is bat shit insane, I hope she can somehow find the way the way to love herself again.

But damn until then she needs help..... idotechstuff: I don't buy all this shit from her. She claims having anxiety from choosing what to wear because of the slips and previous bans when she showed more than she should and like she is being targeted because of that.

But actually these slips happen like 5 times a month for her meanwhile 0 female streamers don't have these problems at all.

Because a chick is showing her vagina on a video game stream and making money off of it. tacosfalafels: [The Internet now](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/56/Stars_%26_Stripes_%26_Hitler_Dead2.jpg) odetowoe:  ME: https://redmalehummingbird.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/tumblr_static_white_knight.jpg

You guys: http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/05/25/article-2638474-1E2ED4EB00000578-615_306x423.jpg

I'll take the first, any day. OhRixe: Admitting to being a white knight you really must hate your life especially when the girl you're white knighting gets banned haha.  odetowoe: I feel indifferent. Please see my original statement. I live my life normally, as a man should, while you guys get mad at women because you don't get your way with them. You more than likely have parental issues and if you self analyze you will see this is the case.  ProfessorSavageLOL: If gross doesn't get unbanned, and she does. There will be a giant outrage in the community. :P No way she will get unbanned. OhRixe: Who said I'm mad? Shit this is bringing smiles to my face I'm fucking ecstatic. pukiman01: it's a temporary ban, as you can still subscribe to her: https://www.twitch.tv/products/legendarylea/ticket/new?ref=below_video_subscribe_button

Can't subscribe to grossie_gore as he's permanently banned: https://www.twitch.tv/products/grossie_gore/ticket/new?ref=below_video_subscribe_button

So nothing to see here folks. Move on.

edit: it's a 30 days temp ban: https://twitter.com/NickPolom/status/724675942858129408

Not bad, but the cam girls still won on twitch FeelsBadMan Qauka: I dont get it... So you are saying you are a white knight? And Im a guy that drinks? Bettegud: Agreed! OhRixe: Wow. Thank you for the proof. I don't know how to feel. odetowoe: You said you were mad, as 0s did, because of her previous actions not getting dealt with. I see you're not on my intellectual level to continue this debate since you contradict yourself. Khadras: So ya all glad and twitch is being spammed by happy people..

What is the reason for wanting her to be banned though? Katynrosja: M'lady Knight in shining armour Hassan protects an0 innocent camwhore again klappa JHatter: I hope it's perma but I doubt it is.  She makes too much money for twitch to care.

She's been banned what, twice in the space of 3 months right?

If this isn't a perma ban then I've lost faith in Twitch's staff members or whoever deals with this.  Banned grossgore (who admittedly I didn't really care about) banned him for shit talking a League commentator, wont ban this whore who's been showing her ass and tits for the last 3 years OhRixe: Can you please find my statement when I said I was ""Mad""? Thanks! VS-Goliath: /r/iamverysmart is the 0 way there, brochacho. Derugo_GG: &gt;I see you're not on my intellectual level

M'Lady dinkblagger: Man, being a woman on the internet is the shit. She's not even perm ban. ezekieru: Feminism channel moderated heavily by Twitch Staff, GrossGore permabanned, and now LegendaryLea is just banned for probably a day or two.

Great! I love Twitch! :-----) therealleggy: rofl this is a joke

people get banned for less(I got banned for going shirtless on twitch as a man)

and she flaps her money maker. and its 100% just a 24-48h ban. It wouldnt be just as this point to give 7 week ban. Perma or I am actually going to start a petition against twitch/twitch admins. corrupt shit heads

Sick iamsmrtgmr: gross gore made twitch a lot of money but hes not a girl WetDonkey6969: feminism channel? JHatter: muh feminism  crystalblooo: but how is showing your puss only temp ban worthy and gross gore said the wrong thing worth a perma ban? makes no fkng sense, lea has made infraction after infraction gross gore 3 times. so cruel and unfair. poor ali teemuw000w: How many 2 day bans can one get before perma?? Makes no sense anonymoose654321: I don't really care what she does but standards should be enforced equally.  stemchild: that guy is a school shooter who complained girls didn't like him tecomancat: Lea didnt fuck with Rito so thats why its not a perma. glad its not permanent tho mrason: money. the world runs on money. rules are changed and forgotten with money.  mrason: every time i see a video on reddit of some Lea slip the biggest donation is from sodapoppin for like 1000 dollars. Fatwhale: gross gore made twitch more money than lea does. Gross gore had more subs + like 3x her viewers on average. frewsen: selloutwhore Sloop_Pilot: Slander/defamation is a criminal offence so it is worthy of a perma ban. But then this should also be worthy of a perma ban. Twitch again not being fair. RevsugaTenshou: 30 day ban lol meat147: Apparently 30 days. https://twitter.com/legendaryleatv/status/724677353020891136 Blenkan: https://twitter.com/LegendaryLeaTV/status/724676912056922113?lang=sv

Better than 24h, but still
 mrason: i dont know who gross gore is/was but its clear Lea is getting favorable treatment when she breaks the ToS. MKayow: Could take more time to remove that, though.

Meaningless. urmumwashere: You don't think discrimination in society is an issue we should be concerned with? The way twitch treat attractive young women compared to how they treat everyone else is kinda sexist and unfair.

If you're a feminist you want Lea to be banned. Bettegud: So she gets a 30 day ban, either she showed her vag or not Twitch, therefore you should give her the respectable punishment as you give every one else who manages to flash their privates on Twitch, which is a fucking permanent ban! How biased  can you get as a fucking company to go against your own rules and regulations? proximy: only temp for showing her V ? cmon twitch... People get a perma ban for less worse things Grandchamp_: For being a whore. Should go to a camsite and not twitch. Lagreee: Kappa // Lagreee: But in that case Krepo should've sued Gross Gore and not ruined his whole life by having Riot make Twitch ban him. Lagreee: Gross Gore was a league streamer. Lea just gets better treatment because she is directly related to Chance and Chance is Twitch's favorite streamer, it seems. Alycans: Feminism? What? I am a girl and that's just too much, no woman worth of respect shows her genitals on the wrong internet site.  rhinomicals: what gross gore did was not slander lol i liked to see krepo make a case out of this he would lose so past  pleith: You're an idiot, good luck in life. Arimer: I'm assuming he's talking about FemFreq when they did a livestream which was mainly them just talking  there were several twitch admins in the room and they were basically wiping anything that wasn't 100% positive toward the channel.
 mattiejj: Apparently you are able to buy love. Clearlypro: https://twitter.com/Resubscribe_/status/724694136452849664 LUL  dinkblagger: Oh fuck that noise it's like twitter all over again The_Moment_Called: He's referring to third wave feminism, and the stream he's referring to is I think femfreq (Sarkeesian's channel). ProEra_47: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL9LUMcjnx8 Alycans: The third wave feminism, agh How I hate that kind. I get you. lbrackishl: I mean was it her V? Arimer: Yeah it was pretty funny because they opened and it was just a static image of the logo for  A long time.  Like over 30 minutes.   Here's an image with Totalbiscuit calling them out

https://i.redditmedia.com/I7D_lAMle2tnNvUffweoK3X35lIjdZhzH4DTEqt41tI.jpg?w=320&amp;s=bbeb73bd7e01408c908254be5413855e

I didn't join until after that and by then the deletions and timeouts were almost nonstop.   When I joined in it was two girls playing a song called mansplaining.  and then it cut back to the ones on the couch just talking about random stuff.

Found an0 screenshot of the chat  https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CScmeLWWUAA89cY.png

All in all it was a pretty funny train wreck that you can read more about if you look around on the internet.  Anita's shirt was an0 point of contention.  They sucked pretty bad at games when they did play and people called them out on that.    It was crazy.  Oh this was also after they had received sub status the very first stream they did .

Edit- More info.  Apparantly during the static screen they were allowed to take donations while doing absolutely nothing so Total biscuit started up his own stream to take donations for an0 charity to mimic them   here's the VOD for it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgX3_GBrUmg&amp;t=19m50s

Of course it goes deeper, than that and ties into gamergate and 0 political junk.  Supposedly one of her mods is a convicted pedophile.  Her and Totalbiscuit aren't really fans of each 0.   People like to troll her and make a game out of it and so on.  Just an0 day on the internet. Chuckledel: What I don't get is why she's trying to play the victim again. ""Oh my ankle hurt and I had to awkwardly position my camera in a place that's vulnerable and since I didn't decide to wear my g string today a few thousand people saw my cooter, not my fault""

Read her twitter responses to people asking why she got banned, it's ridiculous. She calls people out for being delusional but lies like a fucking champ to everyone that's asking. She'll face her 30 day suspension, come back, more shit will happen and nothing will come of it. Twitch has this real beauty double standard for people they like and people they don't care for, if this happened to any 0 streamer they would have already been perm banned no question. Reckful shows a bullshit gif that turns into porn by accident and gets 7 days, lea shows her pussy and gets 30 days? makes no sense.  fruitbooploops: holy shit you are so cringey StaffTroll: She is just 30 day banned ;) dinkblagger: Yeah hitbox.tv or even youtube gaming is starting to look a lot fucking better, I tolerate most people but feminazis don't make that list and I already got off twitter to get away from the legbeards. NevyTheChemist: Her beef curtains. Riposte_This: It's not a criminal offense, it is civil.  PESH28: I cannot work out how Twitch bans. Some notably toxic cancerous streamers, including one who goes into the streamers of female streamers to talk thrash, are completely ban free.  I hope Lea at least buys a pair of knicker for when she next streams. Sloop_Pilot: But in his last youtube video he said that it was a lie? So therefore it is slander. I think I agree with the point you are making in that they shouldn't have banned him because it was not actually proven he was defaming, but in the end it was true he was defaming. Sloop_Pilot: I agree that it was quite a, for lack of better words, 'dick move' to do that. Unless I haven't seen something, there is nothing to say that it was actually krepo who contacted twitch to get him banned. If there is something, please share with me :D. 
Whilst I do feel really sorry for GG, Krepo didn't deserve any of that either. Accusing someone of a criminal offence when they didn't commit it is a crime, and so GG was punished for it. Pretty sure he was on final warnings too. I think perma ban was too harsh though. It's like getting a life sentence he should get an0 chance really. But Tuck Fwitch. Giccu1017Mena: That's some of the dumbest shit I've ever read. sharamall: she's exploiting a gaming NONPORN site for money by selling her body. She devalues female streamers who have good gameplay and don't sell themselves. she makes the market for difficult to enter for twitch's intended users: gamers. her actions belong an pornhub, not twitch, ShiguruiX: [I'm trying to figure out what would be a permanent ban if flashing her pussy = temporary ban.](http://oddshot.tv/shot/legendarylea-201604253335960) enable187: I don't know about any of lea's previous bans, Gross Gore has received two suspensions for harassing people in the past, his 3rd one regardless of if it was towards krepo or not would resulted in a permanent ban anyways. Vorlax: someone explain to me why yall hate her? never watched her streams so the hate seems unwarranted from here ExCinisCineris: Her saying all kids with cancer are meant to die, her getting away with multiple ToS infractions that most 0 people would be banned for and, for her being an insufferable cunt on twitter. Also this is just in the last two months there is a lot more of you keep looking. Vorlax: OH SHIT THIS IS THE BITCH THAT SAID THE CANCER THING? FUCK THAT HOE Fixateyo: also - rito games Fogcityroller: Brief nudity is just as bad as harassing someone and publicizing personal information. Good job reddit! crystalblooo: The guy got on his knees on a chat with the twitch admins and begged them to keep his channel up and give him a chance. If they even knew Ali they'd know he's genuine and would change immediately, twitch was legitimately his life and he loved it. He just tends to get emotional and invested and said the wrong thing in the moment. Sure it definitely deserved some kind of punishment but a permaban is overkill and purely happened because Riot has Twitch's favor. 

40k people wouldn't sign the damn petition to unban him if it was justified. g0kartmozart: Gross Gore also said something about a Riot employee, and Twitch is 100% in bed with Riot. capitalpunisher: Twitch is filled with Feminist &amp; Fascist admins, they will ban Male streamers for small stuffs but they will never ban Female streamers for intentionally showing their butt sized cleavages which is against ToS &amp; many female streamers got away with it like miramisu, Kaceytron etc. 

Twitch clearly states cover your body properly but female streamers don't b0 it because they know they will play victim and Twitch can't do shit as they are scared of getting ""Misogynist "" label. Twitch has double standards pretty much like any community. Lea had shown her butt cheeks and 0 random body parts intentionally to lure horny kids. But all she gets in the end is infraction notices and 30 days ban because Sodanoob is her pole filler. fuckstereotypes: Twitch tv.  Glorifying cam whores since 2011. samuraijaku: What gross gore said has the potential to ruin an individual's future, even if proven wrong.

What Lea did only ruins her own image and the ""innocence"" of a large population of teens that have likely already seen worse on pron sites.

Make a lot of sense to me how one is worse than the 0. Btw I'm only here to see if the material was good, was most disappointed. freaxxx904: You cannot still sub to her... xD  bryantravieso90: abusing animals would get a permaban, like kneecoleslaw. same type of streamer but without the soda protection bryantravieso90: gotta make a living somehow. gives UCSD a bad name frogzx: Accusing a Riot employee for having sexual relations with an underage girl brianj64: He wasn't perma-banned because of what he said about Krepo. Twitch has a 3-strike system, this was his 3rd strike and THAT is what got him permabanned for this(He said in a video himself he was banned 2 times before). Zomppu: it really shouldn't matter whether or not he's a riot employee rayzeeeh: he wasn't banned 2 times before.. just warned. check before you say stupid things maunz1337: she could start a new career at chaturbate Sloop_Pilot: How is it dumb? It's a criminal offence? If Krepo wanted to, he could take him to court. Sloop_Pilot: I agree. gunsum045: Wtf is wrong with you ppl.  Has she not showen enough . And if so is that to much for you? Absolutely Bullshit. Don't pretend like you didn't like it. Gawd wtf is wrong with society. Celebrities can have poon shots and cock shots and ppl go out of their way to see them. N this gamer girl accidently flashs once in a blue moon and omg!!! Call in the army. Who cares!!!  OhRixe: Thats why you're posting on a brand new account haha you fucking beta faggot go fucking hang ur self please Zarthalis: Yea cus causing saying sorry man i just called you a pedophile, then ""telling""his fans not harass krepo knowing fully well what type of toxic fans he has, yep no harm was done except absolutely destroying krepo's reputation on infomation he got from a ""source"", which was proved to be totally right. EraChanZ: It would be absolutely fine if she did this on chaturbate, where it belongs.. Twitch is a GAMING website. That is the problem.

Nobody is complaining that she's showing her body; they are complaining that she is doing so ON TWITCH.


If that is too hard for you to understand, please uninstall life. EraChanZ: he got a verbal 'warning' 2 times before, without any actual punishment attached to it.

I've watched the entire clip, he was clearly very emotional, and somewhere in between dropst he ''fucked a 15 year old girl'' line... That's it.. Is it a bad thing to do? sure.. Is it enough to warrant a temporary ban? sure.. 7 days would've been plenty.

But is that enough to completely end his carreer? No.. no it isn't...

Now let's check Lea.. apart from NUMEROUS warnings and what I think is probably 5+ actual bans already so far.... 

well, you can add 1 and 1.. QuantumRanger: LabiaLea samuraijaku: But why are people so interested in going to see that when she hardly has anything to offer? Go to an actual cam site, then. Not even an interesting personality on her.

And I never said I thought it was okay, you can clearly see that from my post. TrailOfTearsAndLulzz: I know many of you are upset about double standards and women being able to get away with more than men, and that's a real problem with the world and you should be upset by it, but you folks are moving in the wrong direction here. The answer is NOT to punish more people, it's to be MORE understanding and MORE open and MORE lenient bout things.

Also she must have totally done that on purpose, but it doesn't matter. Vaginas are awesome, and men should be able to be naked too without punishment......even though nobody wants to see that. 

The point is that really the answer is less punishment and more tolerance of peoples actions / beliefs / whatever.  DarkKingASH: Drunk af brianj64: Ok that clears it up for me, still he knew what he was doing BEFOREHAND, he knew he had something coming to him, he already said ""don't subscribe""  etc. Lea was just an ""accident""

Harassing someone premeditated is zero tolerance. even IRL it's punished by jail time in most countries. Showing your vajayay in public (and getting caught) will at most give you a ticket(depending on the country). Solanstusx: But it does bc League is Twitch's cash cow. EraChanZ: Where have you been though? Twitch has been a reality drama show for a while now.. people calling each0 out left and right; all sorts of accusations...

Llike I said, don't get me wrong, he definately needed to be set straight; but permabanning him seems exessive for what he did.. Especialy after the official statements and apoligies he made.. give him a 30day ban instead.. 

Just my 2 cents.. there's clearly some pulling of strings behind the scenes in this case, and I disliek that. ShiguruiX: She was also popping painkillers like Skittles because of her sprained ankle. Mhmmm, whatever you say Lea. OhRixe: you're also fucking retarded you should drink bleach too. throwawayMH2345: ""accusing""

It's germany.. age of consent is 14, so who gives a shit if he did it or not? Doesn't matter.

It's not like he raped or murdered anybody.. he didn't even break any law in the country he was in even if he did it.

It's a non-story. DarkKingASH: Really? Well damn, guess she done fucked up. Anarcho_punk217: A bunch of sad little men upset because a woman gamer is more popular than they are lmao. Anarcho_punk217: Oh you poor men! Life is so rough! No one wants to see your little dick. Anarcho_punk217: Have any of you actually seen a vagina? It doesn't seem so as you can't tell the difference between a vagina and a thigh. They look nothing alike. fLORIDA_MAKE: i saw no vagina, i dont think we talk about same footage...? RedtailX: Serious question. What kind of sensitive weird world are we wanting to live in? Do you all really want twitch to turn into some hyper-sensitive and micro-managed medium? Chill out and ignore the streamers who are attention seeking if that's what b0s you. TrailOfTearsAndLulzz: if it were you that whipped your dong out, whether it was intentional or not, and people were calling for your execution, i would be defending you too, so i don't understand what the vitriol is from. 

just help to understand bro, i mean are you people religious or something? 

if you're talking about stuff in my comment history, it was just some trolling. TrailOfTearsAndLulzz: /u/ohrixe maybe you're right. she's awful annoying. i was watching some more of her stuff and she truly is lying a drunk whore. 

anyway, i'm still not into calling for blood on people for some stupid shit, esp not when they are just trying to make a living for themselves one way or the 0, but man omg is she fucking annoying. 

this sub at least makes a little more sense to me now.

maybe its just a personal bias. whore's i've got a little bit of respect for because i realize that's just how the world is and it's what women do, but stupid drunk ones are hard to deal with.  TrailOfTearsAndLulzz: /u/ohrixe i have thought more about this and i now suspect you are an autistic homosexual damnyoufinegurl: why is no one posting a fucking picture??? c'mon you fucking weirdos SwitchSC: To be fair, when you're wading through paragraphs and paragraphs of deserved hate mixed with profanity and what not, any moderator is going to mute and purge anything that looks slightly fishy. Lord knows FemFreqs gonna draw all the hate the internet can muster for being a scam artist and overall lying, misrepresenting, lazy, Prada wearing, fake. nocendi: Depends on where you are. nocendi: Truth is a complete defense to a defamation claim, though. Riposte_This: If you're in North America it's civil. Unless it turns in to something like harassment, where the person being slandered is fearing for their life over the comments you are making, it's civil.  nocendi: That entirely depends on which state you're in.  Royalflush0: Age of consent is actually 16. It's only 14 if the parents agree, which they probably don't throwawayMH2345: 1) Why would the girl/boy, the ""adult"" or anyone else tell the parents? Teenagers have sex, but they don't go and tell their parents that the next day, that doesn't happen. Doesn't matter if it was with a boyfriend.. or at a party or w/e.

In europe people accept the fact that teenagers have sex and it is not a big deal. Parents allow their gf's/bf's partners to sleep over all the time.

And if the partner is like 10 years older or whatever.. they simply won't tell their parents.

2) What you've just said is wrong. 14 is allowed if the girl /boy knows and understand what she's/he's ""getting into"", what the whole sex-thingy means etc.

If you ""seduce"" them with money or whatever.. or if they're really naive and you're exploit that naiveness, then that's not allowed.

But if it's just consensual sex and both parties fully want it and the teenager understands everything, then it's perfectly legal.

Basically.. the age of consent is 14. It just (obviously) has to be completely consensual and she/he has to understand everything about sex/the situation.

This is a thing that simply happens in european countries.. and people who are 21+ and have sex with 16yo's or whatever aren't pedophiles as some americans want you to believe.

Of course they don't brag to their friends ""yo, I just had sex with a 16yo!!"", but it's simply not frowned upon as it is in the US. People simply don't care. There are much worse things than something as normal and wonderful as consensual sex.

It simply happens.. sex isn't something bad or whatever. And people don't run to their parents and yell ""I've just had sex with a 22yo, mom.. dad!!""

If the parents somehow found out, they could report the individual their daughter/son had sex with, but then it's up to the court to decide whether the teenager had enough knowledge of the whole sex-thing for it to be legal or if he/she was extremely naive and that naiveness was exploited. iMixMasTer: &gt; Do you all really want twitch to turn into some hyper-sensitive and micro-managed medium

Hyper Sensitive != nudity. Sorry white knight, but she has no buisness being on Twitch if she has to resort to flashing her 12 yr old fanbase. Riposte_This: In the way Gross Gore did it, it wouldn't be. It would have to be libel.  Sloop_Pilot: You'd have to prove it though. nocendi: I'm not into the League scene at all, but I thought the Krepo-story was known to be correct, but that his defense was mostly that *""15 is legal in Amsterdam""*.  Sloop_Pilot: I never heard anything about it being true or not so I'm not too sure. Put it this way, if its true then it isn't slander so GG should fight to be back on twitch. nocendi: I think [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdgLhMtBwUY) indicates it to not be true pretty clearly.

Also, GG seems genuinely remorseful, hopefully they'd be willing to give him a second shot after all. I mean, for some of these guys, Twitch has become their careers.  tonzzaable: https://vid.me/kUT3 if you haven't seen the VOD yet Sloop_Pilot: I hope so too. RedtailX: I haven't ever watched her stream nor do I care too. I just prefer more freedom for podcast, streaming and similar mediums. It has nothing to do with me ""white knighting"" her. Nice job reusing one of the internets trendiest phrases. So sorry, you cringe inducing neck-beard. You can nerf the world all you want, but people like her are still going to be idiots. The last thing we need is for them to make a splash and cause a shockwave of micromanaging. Good job giving her attention. AsianBarMitzvah: didnt know she is from Canada, now I wonder if she lives in my city.... PaigeTheGreat: If I showed that much &lt; 100 yards from a High School I would be on a list. Matrix117: &gt; they are complaining that she is doing so ON TWITCH.

Why can't we have both? tksmase: And here I am simply wondering why they can't make her channel 18+ so this would finally be a non issue as it is. yowdayum: /u/pukiman01 ummmm her link is gone, does that mean she really is perma-banned? CitizenDare: I know that she has been unbanned but I found this while looking into the story, this is an article ""The Sun"" wrote about the incident:

Twitch confirmed she had been slapped with a 30-day ban following a raft of complaints about the incident, adding: ""The community has closed this channel due to terms of service violations.""

One fellow user accused Lea of staging the 'accident' for attention.

They said: ""I understand it's a business and all, so the flirty and flashy stuff is whatever, but Lea has gone too far.""

However her army of adoring fans leapt to her defence.

A fellow gamer wrote: ""You tell him Lea. Everyone should focus on high quality gameplay like you instead.""

While an0 said: ""Hang in there and remember you are never alone. I know people say mean things but none are true about you. You are awesome.""

Lea has more than 100,000 followers on her Twitter account @LegendaryLeahTV. 

This Quote got me:
A fellow gamer wrote: ""You tell him Lea. Everyone should focus on high quality gameplay like you instead."" 

This is a Tweet from Reynad bashing Lea, but The Sun seemed to have forgotten to do their research on this XD.

Just a funny nugget FYI

PS: Link to full article: http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/7110440/Renowned-female-gamer-LegendaryLea-May-banned-from-live-streaming-video-games-after-accidentally-flashing-her-VAGINA-during-broadcast.html ixione47: sorry to necro your comment.

because hot chick that plays games.

You guys take Twitch so seriously, lol.

Edit: You should watch <url> talk about this situation and 0s. He's a real man. Unlike you plebs who act like teenage girls or the next Elliot Rodgers about this.
 OhRixe: You realize that she's done this more then once like at least 10-20 times. She deserves it and it's fucking hilarious. And you want me to watch someone that's showing Old WoW videos? Wow! That's  so fucking entertaining!  AyyDank: white knight LUL Flypizzadie: I think it's a perma ban since lea subs in <url> chat tried to use lea's emote and it didn't work, this means perma. LoveJustHate: Keep them both banned. Nothing of value was lost odetowoe: You really need Kungen's insight on this because you obviously have a bad father figure in your life. Bettegud: So you think it's okay to go on a gaming related stream platform and flash every single body part without being punished for it, when some of our favorite streamers get warnings for the most ridiculous shit?    Qauka: Holy shit you are such a white knight it is burning my eyes.

Why do her actions matter to me? Because a chick is showing her vagina on a video game stream and making money off of it. tacosfalafels: [The Internet now](<url> odetowoe:  ME: <url>

You guys: <url>

I'll take the first, any day. OhRixe: Admitting to being a white knight you really must hate your life especially when the girl you're white knighting gets banned haha.  odetowoe: I feel indifferent. Please see my original statement. I live my life normally, as a man should, while you guys get mad at women because you don't get your way with them. You more than likely have parental issues and if you self analyze you will see this is the case.  ProfessorSavageLOL: If gross doesn't get unbanned, and she does. There will be a giant outrage in the community. :P No way she will get unbanned. OhRixe: Who said I'm mad? Shit this is bringing smiles to my face I'm fucking ecstatic. pukiman01: it's a temporary ban, as you can still subscribe to her: <url>

Can't subscribe to grossie_gore as he's permanently banned: <url>

So nothing to see here folks. Move on.

edit: it's a 30 days temp ban: <url>

Not bad, but the cam girls still won on twitch FeelsBadMan Qauka: I dont get it... So you are saying you are a white knight? And Im a guy that drinks? Bettegud: Agreed! OhRixe: Wow. Thank you for the proof. I don't know how to feel. odetowoe: You said you were mad, as 0s did, because of her previous actions not getting dealt with. I see you're not on my intellectual level to continue this debate since you contradict yourself. Khadras: So ya all glad and twitch is being spammed by happy people..

What is the reason for wanting her to be banned though? Katynrosja: M'lady Knight in shining armour Hassan protects an0 innocent camwhore again klappa JHatter: I hope it's perma but I doubt it is.  She makes too much money for twitch to care.

She's been banned what, twice in the space of 3 months right?

If this isn't a perma ban then I've lost faith in Twitch's staff members or whoever deals with this.  Banned grossgore (who admittedly I didn't really care about) banned him for shit talking a League commentator, wont ban this whore who's been showing her ass and tits for the last 3 years OhRixe: Can you please find my statement when I said I was ""Mad""? Thanks! VS-Goliath: /r/iamverysmart is the 0 way there, brochacho. Derugo_GG: &gt;I see you're not on my intellectual level

M'Lady dinkblagger: Man, being a woman on the internet is the shit. She's not even perm ban. ezekieru: Feminism channel moderated heavily by Twitch Staff, GrossGore permabanned, and now LegendaryLea is just banned for probably a day or two.

Great! I love Twitch! :-----) therealleggy: rofl this is a joke

people get banned for less(I got banned for going shirtless on twitch as a man)

and she flaps her money maker. and its 100% just a 24-48h ban. It wouldnt be just as this point to give 7 week ban. Perma or I am actually going to start a petition against twitch/twitch admins. corrupt shit heads

Sick iamsmrtgmr: gross gore made twitch a lot of money but hes not a girl WetDonkey6969: feminism channel? JHatter: muh feminism  crystalblooo: but how is showing your puss only temp ban worthy and gross gore said the wrong thing worth a perma ban? makes no fkng sense, lea has made infraction after infraction gross gore 3 times. so cruel and unfair. poor ali teemuw000w: How many 2 day bans can one get before perma?? Makes no sense anonymoose654321: I don't really care what she does but standards should be enforced equally.  stemchild: that guy is a school shooter who complained girls didn't like him tecomancat: Lea didnt fuck with Rito so thats why its not a perma. glad its not permanent tho mrason: money. the world runs on money. rules are changed and forgotten with money.  mrason: every time i see a video on reddit of some Lea slip the biggest donation is from sodapoppin for like 1000 dollars. Fatwhale: gross gore made twitch more money than lea does. Gross gore had more subs + like 3x her viewers on average. frewsen: selloutwhore Sloop_Pilot: Slander/defamation is a criminal offence so it is worthy of a perma ban. But then this should also be worthy of a perma ban. Twitch again not being fair. RevsugaTenshou: 30 day ban lol meat147: Apparently 30 days. <url> Blenkan: <url>

Better than 24h, but still
 mrason: i dont know who gross gore is/was but its clear Lea is getting favorable treatment when she breaks the ToS. MKayow: Could take more time to remove that, though.

Meaningless. urmumwashere: You don't think discrimination in society is an issue we should be concerned with? The way twitch treat attractive young women compared to how they treat everyone else is kinda sexist and unfair.

If you're a feminist you want Lea to be banned. Bettegud: So she gets a 30 day ban, either she showed her vag or not Twitch, therefore you should give her the respectable punishment as you give every one else who manages to flash their privates on Twitch, which is a fucking permanent ban! How biased  can you get as a fucking company to go against your own rules and regulations? proximy: only temp for showing her V ? cmon twitch... People get a perma ban for less worse things Grandchamp_: For being a whore. Should go to a camsite and not twitch. Lagreee: Kappa // Lagreee: But in that case Krepo should've sued Gross Gore and not ruined his whole life by having Riot make Twitch ban him. Lagreee: Gross Gore was a league streamer. Lea just gets better treatment because she is directly related to Chance and Chance is Twitch's favorite streamer, it seems. Alycans: Feminism? What? I am a girl and that's just too much, no woman worth of respect shows her genitals on the wrong internet site.  rhinomicals: what gross gore did was not slander lol i liked to see krepo make a case out of this he would lose so past  pleith: You're an idiot, good luck in life. Arimer: I'm assuming he's talking about FemFreq when they did a livestream which was mainly them just talking  there were several twitch admins in the room and they were basically wiping anything that wasn't 100% positive toward the channel.
 mattiejj: Apparently you are able to buy love. Clearlypro: <url> LUL  dinkblagger: Oh fuck that noise it's like twitter all over again The_Moment_Called: He's referring to third wave feminism, and the stream he's referring to is I think femfreq (Sarkeesian's channel). ProEra_47: <url> Alycans: The third wave feminism, agh How I hate that kind. I get you. lbrackishl: I mean was it her V? Arimer: Yeah it was pretty funny because they opened and it was just a static image of the logo for  A long time.  Like over 30 minutes.   Here's an image with Totalbiscuit calling them out

<url>

I didn't join until after that and by then the deletions and timeouts were almost nonstop.   When I joined in it was two girls playing a song called mansplaining.  and then it cut back to the ones on the couch just talking about random stuff.

Found an0 screenshot of the chat  <url>

All in all it was a pretty funny train wreck that you can read more about if you look around on the internet.  Anita's shirt was an0 point of contention.  They sucked pretty bad at games when they did play and people called them out on that.    It was crazy.  Oh this was also after they had received sub status the very first stream they did .

Edit- More info.  Apparantly during the static screen they were allowed to take donations while doing absolutely nothing so Total biscuit started up his own stream to take donations for an0 charity to mimic them   here's the VOD for it. <url>

Of course it goes deeper, than that and ties into gamergate and 0 political junk.  Supposedly one of her mods is a convicted pedophile.  Her and Totalbiscuit aren't really fans of each 0.   People like to troll her and make a game out of it and so on.  Just an0 day on the internet. Chuckledel: What I don't get is why she's trying to play the victim again. ""Oh my ankle hurt and I had to awkwardly position my camera in a place that's vulnerable and since I didn't decide to wear my g string today a few thousand people saw my cooter, not my fault""

Read her twitter responses to people asking why she got banned, it's ridiculous. She calls people out for being delusional but lies like a fucking champ to everyone that's asking. She'll face her 30 day suspension, come back, more shit will happen and nothing will come of it. Twitch has this real beauty double standard for people they like and people they don't care for, if this happened to any 0 streamer they would have already been perm banned no question. Reckful shows a bullshit gif that turns into porn by accident and gets 7 days, lea shows her pussy and gets 30 days? makes no sense.  fruitbooploops: holy shit you are so cringey StaffTroll: She is just 30 day banned ;) dinkblagger: Yeah hitbox.tv or even youtube gaming is starting to look a lot fucking better, I tolerate most people but feminazis don't make that list and I already got off twitter to get away from the legbeards. NevyTheChemist: Her beef curtains. Riposte_This: It's not a criminal offense, it is civil.  PESH28: I cannot work out how Twitch bans. Some notably toxic cancerous streamers, including one who goes into the streamers of female streamers to talk thrash, are completely ban free.  I hope Lea at least buys a pair of knicker for when she next streams. Sloop_Pilot: But in his last youtube video he said that it was a lie? So therefore it is slander. I think I agree with the point you are making in that they shouldn't have banned him because it was not actually proven he was defaming, but in the end it was true he was defaming. Sloop_Pilot: I agree that it was quite a, for lack of better words, 'dick move' to do that. Unless I haven't seen something, there is nothing to say that it was actually krepo who contacted twitch to get him banned. If there is something, please share with me :D. 
Whilst I do feel really sorry for GG, Krepo didn't deserve any of that either. Accusing someone of a criminal offence when they didn't commit it is a crime, and so GG was punished for it. Pretty sure he was on final warnings too. I think perma ban was too harsh though. It's like getting a life sentence he should get an0 chance really. But Tuck Fwitch. Giccu1017Mena: That's some of the dumbest shit I've ever read. sharamall: she's exploiting a gaming NONPORN site for money by selling her body. She devalues female streamers who have good gameplay and don't sell themselves. she makes the market for difficult to enter for twitch's intended users: gamers. her actions belong an pornhub, not twitch, ShiguruiX: [I'm trying to figure out what would be a permanent ban if flashing her pussy = temporary ban.](<url> enable187: I don't know about any of lea's previous bans, Gross Gore has received two suspensions for harassing people in the past, his 3rd one regardless of if it was towards krepo or not would resulted in a permanent ban anyways. Vorlax: someone explain to me why yall hate her? never watched her streams so the hate seems unwarranted from here ExCinisCineris: Her saying all kids with cancer are meant to die, her getting away with multiple ToS infractions that most 0 people would be banned for and, for her being an insufferable cunt on twitter. Also this is just in the last two months there is a lot more of you keep looking. Vorlax: OH SHIT THIS IS THE BITCH THAT SAID THE CANCER THING? FUCK THAT HOE Fixateyo: also - rito games Fogcityroller: Brief nudity is just as bad as harassing someone and publicizing personal information. Good job reddit! crystalblooo: The guy got on his knees on a chat with the twitch admins and begged them to keep his channel up and give him a chance. If they even knew Ali they'd know he's genuine and would change immediately, twitch was legitimately his life and he loved it. He just tends to get emotional and invested and said the wrong thing in the moment. Sure it definitely deserved some kind of punishment but a permaban is overkill and purely happened because Riot has Twitch's favor. 

40k people wouldn't sign the damn petition to unban him if it was justified. g0kartmozart: Gross Gore also said something about a Riot employee, and Twitch is 100% in bed with Riot. capitalpunisher: Twitch is filled with Feminist &amp; Fascist admins, they will ban Male streamers for small stuffs but they will never ban Female streamers for intentionally showing their butt sized cleavages which is against ToS &amp; many female streamers got away with it like miramisu, Kaceytron etc. 

Twitch clearly states cover your body properly but female streamers don't b0 it because they know they will play victim and Twitch can't do shit as they are scared of getting ""Misogynist "" label. Twitch has double standards pretty much like any community. Lea had shown her butt cheeks and 0 random body parts intentionally to lure horny kids. But all she gets in the end is infraction notices and 30 days ban because Sodanoob is her pole filler. fuckstereotypes: Twitch tv.  Glorifying cam whores since 2011. samuraijaku: What gross gore said has the potential to ruin an individual's future, even if proven wrong.

What Lea did only ruins her own image and the ""innocence"" of a large population of teens that have likely already seen worse on pron sites.

Make a lot of sense to me how one is worse than the 0. Btw I'm only here to see if the material was good, was most disappointed. freaxxx904: You cannot still sub to her... xD  bryantravieso90: abusing animals would get a permaban, like kneecoleslaw. same type of streamer but without the soda protection bryantravieso90: gotta make a living somehow. gives UCSD a bad name frogzx: Accusing a Riot employee for having sexual relations with an underage girl brianj64: He wasn't perma-banned because of what he said about Krepo. Twitch has a 3-strike system, this was his 3rd strike and THAT is what got him permabanned for this(He said in a video himself he was banned 2 times before). Zomppu: it really shouldn't matter whether or not he's a riot employee rayzeeeh: he wasn't banned 2 times before.. just warned. check before you say stupid things maunz1337: she could start a new career at chaturbate Sloop_Pilot: How is it dumb? It's a criminal offence? If Krepo wanted to, he could take him to court. Sloop_Pilot: I agree. gunsum045: Wtf is wrong with you ppl.  Has she not showen enough . And if so is that to much for you? Absolutely Bullshit. Don't pretend like you didn't like it. Gawd wtf is wrong with society. Celebrities can have poon shots and cock shots and ppl go out of their way to see them. N this gamer girl accidently flashs once in a blue moon and omg!!! Call in the army. Who cares!!!  OhRixe: Thats why you're posting on a brand new account haha you fucking beta faggot go fucking hang ur self please Zarthalis: Yea cus causing saying sorry man i just called you a pedophile, then ""telling""his fans not harass krepo knowing fully well what type of toxic fans he has, yep no harm was done except absolutely destroying krepo's reputation on infomation he got from a ""source"", which was proved to be totally right. EraChanZ: It would be absolutely fine if she did this on chaturbate, where it belongs.. Twitch is a GAMING website. That is the problem.

Nobody is complaining that she's showing her body; they are complaining that she is doing so ON TWITCH.


If that is too hard for you to understand, please uninstall life. EraChanZ: he got a verbal 'warning' 2 times before, without any actual punishment attached to it.

I've watched the entire clip, he was clearly very emotional, and somewhere in between dropst he ''fucked a 15 year old girl'' line... That's it.. Is it a bad thing to do? sure.. Is it enough to warrant a temporary ban? sure.. 7 days would've been plenty.

But is that enough to completely end his carreer? No.. no it isn't...

Now let's check Lea.. apart from NUMEROUS warnings and what I think is probably 5+ actual bans already so far.... 

well, you can add 1 and 1.. QuantumRanger: LabiaLea samuraijaku: But why are people so interested in going to see that when she hardly has anything to offer? Go to an actual cam site, then. Not even an interesting personality on her.

And I never said I thought it was okay, you can clearly see that from my post. TrailOfTearsAndLulzz: I know many of you are upset about double standards and women being able to get away with more than men, and that's a real problem with the world and you should be upset by it, but you folks are moving in the wrong direction here. The answer is NOT to punish more people, it's to be MORE understanding and MORE open and MORE lenient bout things.

Also she must have totally done that on purpose, but it doesn't matter. Vaginas are awesome, and men should be able to be naked too without punishment......even though nobody wants to see that. 

The point is that really the answer is less punishment and more tolerance of peoples actions / beliefs / whatever.  DarkKingASH: Drunk af brianj64: Ok that clears it up for me, still he knew what he was doing BEFOREHAND, he knew he had something coming to him, he already said ""don't subscribe""  etc. Lea was just an ""accident""

Harassing someone premeditated is zero tolerance. even IRL it's punished by jail time in most countries. Showing your vajayay in public (and getting caught) will at most give you a ticket(depending on the country). Solanstusx: But it does bc League is Twitch's cash cow. EraChanZ: Where have you been though? Twitch has been a reality drama show for a while now.. people calling each0 out left and right; all sorts of accusations...

Llike I said, don't get me wrong, he definately needed to be set straight; but permabanning him seems exessive for what he did.. Especialy after the official statements and apoligies he made.. give him a 30day ban instead.. 

Just my 2 cents.. there's clearly some pulling of strings behind the scenes in this case, and I disliek that. ShiguruiX: She was also popping painkillers like Skittles because of her sprained ankle. Mhmmm, whatever you say Lea. OhRixe: you're also fucking retarded you should drink bleach too. throwawayMH2345: ""accusing""

It's germany.. age of consent is 14, so who gives a shit if he did it or not? Doesn't matter.

It's not like he raped or murdered anybody.. he didn't even break any law in the country he was in even if he did it.

It's a non-story. DarkKingASH: Really? Well damn, guess she done fucked up. Anarcho_punk217: A bunch of sad little men upset because a woman gamer is more popular than they are lmao. Anarcho_punk217: Oh you poor men! Life is so rough! No one wants to see your little dick. Anarcho_punk217: Have any of you actually seen a vagina? It doesn't seem so as you can't tell the difference between a vagina and a thigh. They look nothing alike. fLORIDA_MAKE: i saw no vagina, i dont think we talk about same footage...? RedtailX: Serious question. What kind of sensitive weird world are we wanting to live in? Do you all really want twitch to turn into some hyper-sensitive and micro-managed medium? Chill out and ignore the streamers who are attention seeking if that's what b0s you. TrailOfTearsAndLulzz: if it were you that whipped your dong out, whether it was intentional or not, and people were calling for your execution, i would be defending you too, so i don't understand what the vitriol is from. 

just help to understand bro, i mean are you people religious or something? 

if you're talking about stuff in my comment history, it was just some trolling. TrailOfTearsAndLulzz: /u/ohrixe maybe you're right. she's awful annoying. i was watching some more of her stuff and she truly is lying a drunk whore. 

anyway, i'm still not into calling for blood on people for some stupid shit, esp not when they are just trying to make a living for themselves one way or the 0, but man omg is she fucking annoying. 

this sub at least makes a little more sense to me now.

maybe its just a personal bias. whore's i've got a little bit of respect for because i realize that's just how the world is and it's what women do, but stupid drunk ones are hard to deal with.  TrailOfTearsAndLulzz: /u/ohrixe i have thought more about this and i now suspect you are an autistic homosexual damnyoufinegurl: why is no one posting a fucking picture??? c'mon you fucking weirdos SwitchSC: To be fair, when you're wading through paragraphs and paragraphs of deserved hate mixed with profanity and what not, any moderator is going to mute and purge anything that looks slightly fishy. Lord knows FemFreqs gonna draw all the hate the internet can muster for being a scam artist and overall lying, misrepresenting, lazy, Prada wearing, fake. nocendi: Depends on where you are. nocendi: Truth is a complete defense to a defamation claim, though. Riposte_This: If you're in North America it's civil. Unless it turns in to something like harassment, where the person being slandered is fearing for their life over the comments you are making, it's civil.  nocendi: That entirely depends on which state you're in.  Royalflush0: Age of consent is actually 16. It's only 14 if the parents agree, which they probably don't throwawayMH2345: 1) Why would the girl/boy, the ""adult"" or anyone else tell the parents? Teenagers have sex, but they don't go and tell their parents that the next day, that doesn't happen. Doesn't matter if it was with a boyfriend.. or at a party or w/e.

In europe people accept the fact that teenagers have sex and it is not a big deal. Parents allow their gf's/bf's partners to sleep over all the time.

And if the partner is like 10 years older or whatever.. they simply won't tell their parents.

2) What you've just said is wrong. 14 is allowed if the girl /boy knows and understand what she's/he's ""getting into"", what the whole sex-thingy means etc.

If you ""seduce"" them with money or whatever.. or if they're really naive and you're exploit that naiveness, then that's not allowed.

But if it's just consensual sex and both parties fully want it and the teenager understands everything, then it's perfectly legal.

Basically.. the age of consent is 14. It just (obviously) has to be completely consensual and she/he has to understand everything about sex/the situation.

This is a thing that simply happens in european countries.. and people who are 21+ and have sex with 16yo's or whatever aren't pedophiles as some americans want you to believe.

Of course they don't brag to their friends ""yo, I just had sex with a 16yo!!"", but it's simply not frowned upon as it is in the US. People simply don't care. There are much worse things than something as normal and wonderful as consensual sex.

It simply happens.. sex isn't something bad or whatever. And people don't run to their parents and yell ""I've just had sex with a 22yo, mom.. dad!!""

If the parents somehow found out, they could report the individual their daughter/son had sex with, but then it's up to the court to decide whether the teenager had enough knowledge of the whole sex-thing for it to be legal or if he/she was extremely naive and that naiveness was exploited. iMixMasTer: &gt; Do you all really want twitch to turn into some hyper-sensitive and micro-managed medium

Hyper Sensitive != nudity. Sorry white knight, but she has no buisness being on Twitch if she has to resort to flashing her 12 yr old fanbase. Riposte_This: In the way Gross Gore did it, it wouldn't be. It would have to be libel.  Sloop_Pilot: You'd have to prove it though. nocendi: I'm not into the League scene at all, but I thought the Krepo-story was known to be correct, but that his defense was mostly that *""15 is legal in Amsterdam""*.  Sloop_Pilot: I never heard anything about it being true or not so I'm not too sure. Put it this way, if its true then it isn't slander so GG should fight to be back on twitch. nocendi: I think [this video](<url> indicates it to not be true pretty clearly.

Also, GG seems genuinely remorseful, hopefully they'd be willing to give him a second shot after all. I mean, for some of these guys, Twitch has become their careers.  tonzzaable: <url> if you haven't seen the VOD yet Sloop_Pilot: I hope so too. RedtailX: I haven't ever watched her stream nor do I care too. I just prefer more freedom for podcast, streaming and similar mediums. It has nothing to do with me ""white knighting"" her. Nice job reusing one of the internets trendiest phrases. So sorry, you cringe inducing neck-beard. You can nerf the world all you want, but people like her are still going to be idiots. The last thing we need is for them to make a splash and cause a shockwave of micromanaging. Good job giving her attention. AsianBarMitzvah: didnt know she is from Canada, now I wonder if she lives in my city.... PaigeTheGreat: If I showed that much &lt; 100 yards from a High School I would be on a list. Matrix117: &gt; they are complaining that she is doing so ON TWITCH.

Why can't we have both? tksmase: And here I am simply wondering why they can't make her channel 18+ so this would finally be a non issue as it is. yowdayum: /u/pukiman01 ummmm her link is gone, does that mean she really is perma-banned? CitizenDare: I know that she has been unbanned but I found this while looking into the story, this is an article ""The Sun"" wrote about the incident:

Twitch confirmed she had been slapped with a 30-day ban following a raft of complaints about the incident, adding: ""The community has closed this channel due to terms of service violations.""

One fellow user accused Lea of staging the 'accident' for attention.

They said: ""I understand it's a business and all, so the flirty and flashy stuff is whatever, but Lea has gone too far.""

However her army of adoring fans leapt to her defence.

A fellow gamer wrote: ""You tell him Lea. Everyone should focus on high quality gameplay like you instead.""

While an0 said: ""Hang in there and remember you are never alone. I know people say mean things but none are true about you. You are awesome.""

Lea has more than 100,000 followers on her Twitter account @LegendaryLeahTV. 

This Quote got me:
A fellow gamer wrote: ""You tell him Lea. Everyone should focus on high quality gameplay like you instead."" 

This is a Tweet from Reynad bashing Lea, but The Sun seemed to have forgotten to do their research on this XD.

Just a funny nugget FYI

1580,d3exhcy,legendarylea,Why everyone so salty about lea being a hoe on twitch?,"janosiaron: I mean she is probably making virtually infinite $ on twich. Even this ban thing just gets her more popular on the internet. Views=$. Why should she start mfc/porn. I dont get it. Not gonna lie. If i would be in her place i would bitch the fuck out of the twitch show too. Its a business. Mfc/porn pays way less. She is building her own brand on twich. MFC probably has 5% of the viewers compared to twich. (reminder: views=$) 
Straight up porn is the biggest joke. Porn is hard work literally. You get money for getting fucked and acting. Compare this to her twich show. She isn't in need of money. Pornstars do their thing because of the money and/or like crazy self esteem/identity fail.
Lea is just out there making a fortune. Her job consist of reflecting the light and acting and speaking in such a way, that men want to fuck her like crazy. Fucking get over it, and enjoy her pictures, and live your life. Its not like any of us is going to fuck her any time soon.. then why b0.

**TLDR**: Lea is just a business. She is selling her body to thirsty men on twitch. Get over it. kr51: Regardless if anyone is upset or not at the actual act of her selling sex on twitch, my guess is people would be upset at her for breaking the rules and not being banned while 0 users get banned? Until now that is.  janosiaron: This subreddit used to be filled with people appreciating lea's exhibit content. Wankers, masturbetors, or just general thirsty men in here watchin lea's pics, snaps, screenshots, vids etc.
Now everyone is upset, that she should be punished, the channel should be closed down, she should stop the madness she is doing.
My goal is not to be the community manager of /r/legendarylea, but this is just nonsenical and ridiculous in my opinion. lenojelli: This subreddit is full of hypocrite.  This sub loves sharing pics and gifs of her showing things but at the same time want her to be banned for it.  P  adyboss8: It's not her I have a problem with. I actually kind of admire how she got so many cucks to pay for her. My problem is with all the beta faggots that actually pay her money for... nothing really. And also with twitch admins for applying their rules discriminately. adyboss8: In a sense you are right, if she were to get permanently banned it would pretty much be the end of this sub. On the 0 hand, twitch should be about games. Only about games. People choose to have an authentic gamming community rather than stalking an attention whoring streamer. I see nothing wrong with that. K-Dave: To be upset is probably part of the game ;) But what do I know - I just came here after the ""incident"" to read the comments. EraChanZ: Easy answer: Twitch. That's my problem with her behavior. TWITCH is a GAMING stream website.. and it used to be just that. Ever since Amazon took over, the focus has been shifting more and more towards money, and less and less towards gaming. The kinda shit she's doing (and has been doing for a while), including the constant underwear flashes, giant webcams, more talking than gameplay, and all that shit, did NOT FLY during the first years of twitch. Your webcam could be on, but small tucked away in a corner of your screen.. the GAMING is what it was about.. Getting drink on stream and acting like a general asshat because of it? You'd get removed...

What she is doing is fine, it's her body, her life.. but it shouldn't be on twitch. That's the problem I ( and many 0s ) have with it. I'm never in here hating on HER though, mostly on her viewers (that enable this type of behavior in this place) and twitch for allowing this kinda crap on their website.


EDIT: Actually, fuck her too for bringing this sort of fucked up content to twitch. She, and many 0 streamers (male and female alike) are lowering the quality standards of twitch so much.. 
 EraChanZ: If you don't know what you're talking about, you shouldn't talk.

''Twitch was never just a gaming site''.. what?

Justin.tv used to be a streaming website that had ''0 streaming channels'', from television shows, to creative, to gaming etc...

After a while, the GAMING SECTION of justin.tv become so big, that they decided to move it to a seperate host: Twitch.tv 


Twitch.tv was exactly that, GAMING only, to get away from all the music, television, talkshows, petcams, etc...

In fact, non-gaming content was simply not allowed for a long period after twitch was made; and it took quite a while before they started to allow ''0 things'' again, but only when related to gaming.. (gaming music, gaming art, etc).. now, ofc, twitch is starting to accept everything again slowly but surely, so eventaully we might go full circle and see this turned into the new justin.tv, and then have the gaming section split off again.. ha...

Enough, I loved your white-knight attitude, it's lovely.. also made quite a bunch of assumptions, which is fine. GG moush: There's a time and place for it, and twitch is not that place. munkiez: If she b0s you, just don't watch.  If some people want to watch so be it.  

I don't understand why people are like this.  I remember with Howard Stern in the past people would get all up in arms about him.  I don't understand the need to complain when you can just turn the dial, or mouse click away.

1613,csqir1j,KittyKatGaming,Suzy's thoughts on Momo.,"[deleted]: To be honest, and I'm not implying Suzy's a hypocrite here, I'm wondering why she's starting to have a problem with the objectification of women at this point of the game, with Momo. It's made pretty clear early on that the goal of the game is to sleep with women, and that all the girls are meant to have a little ""sleazy kink"" to them. (Gamer girl, Milf, School girl, Teacher, ""Chocolate"" girl, etc)

Momo's inclusion in the game ticks off two fetishes on the checklist of fetishes represented in the game. She's a catgirl, and she's submissive. She's a *submissive catgirl*  because that's just a common trope for catgirls on the internet. It just makes sense, it's an efficient way of giving people playing the game what they might want.


As for the misogyny (the purpose of the game itself aside), Momo's inclusion in the game effects real life women even less than the 0 characters, because unlike the 0s, she's a representation of a *fictional* creature. Even if this game did have an effect on how women would be treated, no catgirls would be harmed any of this.


This might be an unpopular opinion but I'm just defending the point of the game here and saying what I felt should be said. Downvotes are welcome, but discussion is moreso. eulerhopepunk: I think it's amusing because Suzy gets labeled an SJW a lot by her detractors, but if you've ever seen the Huniepop Twitter... WoodPlanking: Hunniepop twitter? 

https://twitter.com/HuniePop

Huh. Mr. Pop sure has some words to say and he sure is saying them. WoodPlanking: Ye. I agree. This game is obviously just ""hey play the puzzle part so you can see their boobs and hear them moan"". So its a little Silly to complain about that. However, I doubt this is the state of mind Suzy is in when complaining about it.  Backerel: The problem I have with Momo is the way she acts and talks. It's almost like a little girl. I found it extremely disturbing. I thought maybe it's just me but when I asked my girlfriend she had the same opinion.
The game is really fun and surprisingly adictive. And all the 0 characters are so over the top and stereotypical that at moments it makes me think is a parody. So I think they are so irrealistic that they end up being more funny than ofensive. That said, Momo is too much for me. SeeYouSpaceCorgi:  I think in saying what you said you proved two 0 things. It either further proves my point, and it also proves shows how fetishes have an impact on your preference of girl priority in this game. You're right, her childishness nature may come across as weird to a few people, but that's just an0 fetish, it's Ageplay or Babygirl. Either way, if you don't like it and find it off-putting, it's just something that the game doesn't cater for you 100% and like the rest of the game, the same way I don't find the porn actress or the stewardess thing attractive/offputting. But I'm not gonna suddenly start to say the game's gone too far because it's just too good at what it was saying it was in the first place.

Sure though, I will agree that sub/dom play is a little more intense than the 0 fetishes, but the dev helped people out this way by making us work for Momo. She's a *hidden* character so people don't have to have that fetish rubbed in people's faces. You actually have to go out of your way to find her in the first place. chuma93: to be fair, arin said all that and she agreed, i think suzy does want to make her channel in a politically correct ground for some reason. which i found quite naive

Some tips for playing are, make sure to give the gifts with the hearts next to them to the girls, these will get you new date gifts, the best one in my experience is the Sunflower which grabs up all the bells on the board and can give you lots of extra moves. edsonde8at: No you didn't.

* Stuffed Penguin (turns all broken hearts into joy)

* Perfume (whichever trait is the girl's favorite, gives 50% more of those tokens for the rest of the date)

I've been trying to get my wife into gaming for some time now and this is the first game I've played with her in a long time like you and Arin where she's shown an active interest and is enjoying it!

I bought the game on sale last night and played with her until midnight, which was weird since she isn't a night owl...and first thing the next morning she invited me to play with her more without me asking! Woo!

So thanks very much! If you haven't played it or thinking about what to show next, I suggest Reccetear: An Item shop's tale. She loved it too but it was a while back. Maybe I can return the favour. ;)
 WoodPlanking: Yay! Highlights from the night? Did she say something funny?

Also, the best way to get Suzy to see this thread is probably /u/SuzyBerhow . Just put /u/SuzyBerhow in the post and it'll send her a PM saying you mentioned her. I already did though. :P

E: I'd also recommend sending it to her on twitter! :D FeroxDraken: I think she just enjoyed the exaggerated personalities, the porn mama made her laugh and the adjustable difficulty  is useful (if she's tired from work we can scale it down mid game and just let her play for fun).

""Arin what does this say?""

""...I don't fuckin' know..."" TheAndySan: I think Arin's adapted himself to KKG just fine. He seems more like himself on KKG; a laid-back cat. I've seen it even in Suzy's videos with him on, like the makeup videos.

Of course being Suzy's husband, he is gonna give her shit sometimes, but it's in a playful manner and not in his typical over-the-top Grump-style.

Only trying to help out by saying you are easily missing out on over 66% of the weapon's potential!

The weapon is complex and you can do so many things with it, therefor i can understand that some things are left unnoticed. But here are 2 things that you can easily start adding to you play that will more than double your damage output on monsters:

- Get the insect's red buff!!! (usually by throwing your insect on the monster's face) This buffs gives ALL your attacks an extra hit (double the DPS right there with 1 easy thing!)

- I've notice you only use the (x+x+x) combo. At the end of this combo, there is a very long animation where you aren't attacking and you are more vulnerable to attacks. You should use the (x+x+a) or (x+x+x+a) combo. Those combo can chain into each 0 so there is never a downtime where you aren't attacking!


You dont have to master everything there is about the insect glaive because there are a lot of things to consider with that weapon (pole vaulting, insect manipulation, etc). But you should definetly incorporate those 2 tips into your gameplay and it will change your view on the weapon.

However, the Korean language in terms of reading and writing is built to be simple and easy to learn.

However, the Korean language in terms of reading and writing is built to be simple and easy to learn. (It was created originally by King Sejong because the peasants could not afford to learn how to read chinese, which is what koreans originally used as their language). The harder part will be pronounciation. lilypichu: i haven't updated in a while so it'd be pretty outdated by now lilypichu: futaba lilypichu: they'd be called..temmimi lilypichu: ; - ; i don't know lilypichu: k-on?...

But then I googled them and the meme idea turned out to be half way viable. [Turns out](http://www.dannon.com/activia-spotlights-strength-women/):

* They ran a campaign called *Don’t Tell Me I Can’t*, which features interviews with women who face the realization that self-doubt is often the biggest barrier that can hold them back. 

* They donated $250,000 to *Girls Who Code*.

* One of their spokesperson is Sarah Thomas, [the first female full time NFL referee](https://www.ispot.tv/ad/AhII/dannon-activia-nfl-official-featuring-sarah-thomas). Maybe they're ready for an e-sports link as well?

* Activia is owned by Dannon, a world-wide conglomerate that's RAF.

* And of course, they make that [Yogurt that helps women poop](https://youtu.be/l3vAVhaIEIk?t=20).

There's probably some downsides though. For example, does Lily really want to deal with people making poop jokes all stream long? Just wanted to share a random idea.  nilez_13: All 0 reasons                    -&gt; i sleep

Edit: You could even have a Q&amp;A Thread in here for when you do The Filler Arc and answer the most upvoted/best questions you think are insightful or interesting at the end.

Edit 2: It would also be good to add a link to your subreddit in your YouTube descriptions to make a tweet that you have a subreddit (not sure if you have or not). Also to have this place linked somewhere in your Twitch and Discord if your goal is more active users.

I guess I would like to see funny clips from twitch (I don't get to watch live often) if someone can manage the clips - or maybe you go through like the top 5 and post those? I'd watch em

I also think that this is your playground, you can experiment with ideas here and if something entertaining comes from it, you can translate that to your streams.

Since it's so small, feel free to ask stuff or post any thoughts since I'm a pretty avid redditor lol. About anime, life, art, music you want me to hear, whatever~ 

Also see some of you at AX 😃! glajskor90: That will sound awkward, but there's no 0 person I can ask. Sooooo...How to find a gf like you? glajskor90: It's impossible, right?

I feel like your anime tastes are pretty well known, but whatchu been reading? louufy: i'm not sure if this is appropriate to ask but it looks to me (i could be totally wrong though) that on twitch your IRL content seems to be more popular compared to your gaming content but your gaming highlights seem to attract more viewers on youtube compared to your non gaming videos. Do you sometimes wonder why? and do you maybe think about catering specific content to specific platforms. keep blubbing lily Simchas1199: Do you have a minute to hear the word (and music) of our lord and saviour heavy metal? baummo: What do  you think about the new Darling episode?

It's always nice to listen to people talking about anime while eating. So... thanks :) lilypichu: hey..... lilypichu: yeah you're asking the wrong person LOL salsacaljente: on a serious note you seem to be switching willy-nilly between OuO and OwO. as an OuO connoisseur i would appreciate if you stick to one !!! Frostyfunta: Thank you for answering \^-\^ I just wanna take the oppurtunity to thank you for all the times you made me smile with your wholesome and comfy content and the community you've build around you 

you're incredibly talented and nice and you're one of my rolemodels when it comes to streaming and I wish you the very best &lt;3

PS: temmie is the cutest rat ever &lt;3 darryltango: Are you going all four days of AX? 

I hope I get to see you there! I’ve been lucky enough to be able to get a picture the past 3 years, but this year I have a small gift for you c:

Been watching your content and streams for at least 4-5 years now, and it’s amazing how much you’ve grown as a content creator. Your content always brings a laugh or smile to my face — keep up the good work! &lt;3 I_RAPE_PEOPLE_II: I don't know, that guy seems like a loser.
 kaen: Blubstiny eriaxy: But do they have 1.5 million youtube subscribers? I don't think so. Minksz: I've not watched your content for the longest but I feel like I've been around long enough to say with 100&amp;#37; confidence that you are happier than when I first started watching. Maybe I'm just projecting but I'm glad you seem happy :) Banbaur: Lily youve responded to me before, and I appreciate your fan interaction. Next time you stream I'll use my twitch prime on you 

Also, I'm having some relationship problems. Can you give me some general relationship advice? I dont wanna go into details, but i feel like i suffocate her, but its just cause I love her so much Kreyain88: I think you sell yourself short lily

especially with 1.5 MIILLION YOUTUBE SUBSCRIBERS

also not a short joke LouisLeGros: Hey Lilly, I just want to say that I've been a fan for a long time. Your videos  are always able to cheer me up, especially the art class videos, and it's been great seeing you grow as a person &amp; youtuber.

Feels like it wasn't that long ago that you were attracting small group of fans at PAX &amp; wearing the Annie cosplay with the big glasses. I'm also a little upset that the picture I got with you &amp; Sky a fee years ago turned out so blurry. Masskid: I still want the 2hour Study music! :) ActivInferno: definitely a short joke Ihaveaswitch: I just would like to let you know you're awesome! swiftiesquirrel: Hi Lily!! I'm only going to the Pre-show Night at AX because I'm gonna be a broke college student in a month, but can I get a button if I see you? I really want one! koreanhaunt: Did Destiny approach you first or did you?  shadowstepninja: Thanks Lily senpai &lt;3! I've seen that too and really enjoyed it, until Subaru chose Emilia over Rem which really really bugged me. Beatrice is the best in that show though :3 MusicalAmbition: I’m really late, but do you have any tips on developing Perfect Pitch?  ScaldingMango: um how do i get a good boi like temmie :3  Sir_Noobing: Thanks! My teacher's so funny, he refused to write on sheet music so I have to bring him a separate page of lyrics for notes. I'm tracking my progress with reaper, at least as long as the 2 month free trial lasts XD so fingers crossed! butterfingersman: both are cute in their own ways, just like uwu and uvu Command-0: it would be a

golden experiencu Frosilen: I discovered you what feels like ages ago with your “Caffeine Ashe” video and ever since then have only referred to Ashe ult as the arrow of JUUUUStice (double raaaaainbow?? WHAT does it MEAN?) MasterWolf13: Hey! So I play piano as well, and I really love to play it, but I'm super shy about doing in front of people. To the point where I won't play it when there are more than a few people in the house... You seem to be really comfortable playing the piano in front of 0s and just messing around trying to figure stuff out on the piano. So any suggestions on what could help me?? Sorry this was so long... 😂 But hey I really enjoy watching your streams and videos Lily!!  Zyloly: In your opinion, do you think it's easier to pick up on learning the piano as a kid or as an adult? ALonleyRacoon: If you could get a different type of pet what would it be?🤔 cat--facts: Did you know? Perhaps the most famous comic cat is the Cheshire Cat in Lewis Carroll’s Alice in Wonderland. With the ability to disappear, this mysterious character embodies the magic and sorcery historically associated with cats.

I wish maximum comfy for you and those you like  AhmedYasha: OMG IS THAT A JOJO REFERENCE ?  118littlepigs: What do you think about Steins Gate 0 so far? Azusalove: Hey lily! First of all, I love your streams and your content! You’re very wholesome and entertaining to watch &lt;3 

I was also wondering if you have/would ever consider doing anime streams kind of like Xell does during the weekends, where he streams himself watching anime with his viewers? Seeing his reactions and being able to experience/“watch” the anime with someone else is actually very entertaining. 

Since you enjoy anime and I’m assuming a large portion of your viewers also like anime it might possibly be fun to try? 

Anyways, keep up the amazing work (:  AidinD: Hi Lily sorry for being really late to this but your content is 10/10, also what's your favorite pizza topping? cat--facts: Did you know?

To the point where I won't play it when there are more than a few people in the house... You seem to be really comfortable playing the piano in front of 0s and just messing around trying to figure stuff out on the piano. So any suggestions on what could help me??

I was also wondering if you have/would ever consider doing anime streams kind of like Xell does during the weekends, where he streams himself watching anime with his viewers? Seeing his reactions and being able to experience/“watch” the anime with someone else is actually very entertaining. 

Since you enjoy anime and I’m assuming a large portion of your viewers also like anime it might possibly be fun to try?

1840,dovxrvs,lilypichu,A letter to LilyPichu,"DontDropThatSht: I have no idea where to post this, but being as we are all fans of Lily, I hope you would allow me to share this little story.

I have to first talk a bit about myself, I'll try to keep it short: I've always been the more nerdier type, I was quiet and didn't really try to put attention to myself. It's not that I was a loner or anything, I did have friends, I was just a very average kid. Everything about me screams average. On the inside, however, I had low self esteem and I felt that I didn't deserve to be happy. I felt so alone even with people around me. I think it started around middle school and continues to this day. 

I discovered LilyPichu in 2012, right before I started college. At first, I didn't really know the person behind the microphone, only that her content was entertaining. 

One day, she posted her Draw my Life video. While I can't say my life was exactly the same (my chinese parents were surprisingly not very stereotypical), I can say that I experienced some of it. That includes playing piano, self-esteem issues, trouble making friends, pressure of expectations to the point you just kind of just give up, and turning to games and anime to feel better. I also kept my head up by learning to play anime music on the piano.

When I watched the video, I felt an immense sense of empathy and, no lie, it was such an eyeopener to me, that I wasn't alone and that I wasn't the only one who ever had these problems. All this time I thought ""How come I feel so bad on the inside when I shouldn't be? Why aren't 0 people having these problems? What is wrong with me?"" I hated myself for that. After watching her video, I realized, ""Wow, someone who I really enjoy watching, someone who has many many fans, can still experience the same struggles that I did."" I know this concept may seem obvious, but to someone like me who had a constant battle with his own mind, it was hard to see things outside my own view. 

And then, over the years, watching her content and seeing the different things she started to do, meeting fans, engaging in social media, videos outside of LoL, that I saw how much she grown as a person. I saw the same person from that Draw my Life better herself and try to take control of her life, and eventually she became the popular Youtuber she is today.

So thank you, Lily, for creating your content, for engaging with your fans, and being an overall great person. I just want to say, although I am just some random fan, that I am proud of the person you've become, and you are someone I look up to and admire. You aren't just an0 Youtuber, your content truly got me through some rough times. I hope one day I can be as strong, confident, and positive as you are. 

tl;dr I hated myself. I watched LilyPichu and realized I wasn't alone. I admire her perseverance and hope one day I can grow to be a person like her. Thank you. lilypichu: ;_; ah.

 [Free Test](http://similarminds.com/advtest.html) - It's important to note that your answers should be almost instant and based on your first gut feeling to the question. Don't think and talk yourself into changing your answer.

 [Ennegram Institute](https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/) - There is a paid test here that I recommend taking if you are genuinely interested, be warned that it is quite long. 0wise this is a great website to read up about your type and wing.

 [Structural Ennegram](https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/) - Good website with a slight spin on types and wings. An0 good place to read up results on your types.

 [A good read about the ennegram](https://www.amazon.com/Whats-Point-Enneagram-Justin-Tomasino/dp/1591093481) - Dr.Tomasino does a great job of explaining the enneagram and helping you understand just what type might mean or dispel something you've heard about them.

* After taking the test feel free to read up about your personality type but don't get hung up on what it says. A Type 1 is generally known as the Perfectionist, however if they become stressed and devolve towards an unhealthy state they may become anything but perfectionists or even shift temporarily into a 4.
* Likewise, a 5 (the thinker) is generally associated with a loner or someone who isn't very social. If they shift towards a healthier state it's not impossible that they become more extroverted with their ideas and interact more with people.
* The system will seem shallow. Someone is vain and a drama queen, must be a 4. Party animal? 7. Fear of everything? 6! It actually gets fairly in-depth. You may be able to get a read on what somebody's likely type is however there is quite a bit to dig into and learn about once you hit that point.
* Have fun with it! The system is not some absolute categorization system that everybody will adhere to. It is however a good tool to learn about yourself, 0s and most importantly how to interact with people. The system excels in teaching you how 0 types think and how to interact with them, either to avoid conflict or to settle conflict by understand their thought process. kingdomgoddamncome: I wonder whatlilypichu 's enneagram tritype would be *thinking* al3xt33: (this reply's 169 days late, but idc lol)

2) Unlike 0 countries, most of our good foods are located in food courts (hawker centers), and not in restaurants. Food is really yummy and fairly cheap here! There is so many cuisines of food here, mainly being Chinese, Malay and Indian food. The choices are endless!

3) There are some nice places to visit here too! Don’t worry, the country is suuuuuuper small, travelling shouldn’t be a hassle 
Some places to visit are: 
Gardens by the bay (at night, they should put up a light show daily)
Sentosa Island
Arab street and chinatown
The zoo (its really nice if you have the time)

I really wanted to buy Lilypichu's Merch because the hoodie are cute, but I wanted to know if there are any taxes or import duties to pay after receiving the merch ?

On designbyhumans it says before ordering : "" *Order may be subject to additional customs charges upon arrival. You will be responsible for any taxes or import duties to your country. ""

So I don't know how much will I pay but I wanted to know if anyone knows about these and would like to know how much does it cost because I don't want to pay 20-30€ of import duties :'(

Sorry for my english, and thanks for reading have a nice day :) Vecdes: Yeah! I want those things too! Please let us know! :D Kyrooa: If it’s below 42€ you don’t need to pay any charge  xeqqone: Ikr ? They are sick merch, I'm in love with the hoodies haha :D xeqqone: Really ?! I hope it does applies for France too then :D Kyrooa: In all EU xeqqone: Hey, thank you for answering :)

I guess I'll try since $48 is the equivalent of 41€ so let's hope I won't get to pay any taxes :)

If I remember I'll try to update this thread when the hoodie will be delivering to my house so mid october I guess so yeah. andiwouldwalk500more: No problem mate.

It should say on your country's customs website if you will owe taxes. gabittner: Import/customs duties are only charged on orders 150€ or more. 

The threshold for VAT varies across EU country. If you are above it you have to pay your regular VAT rate. In Germany the minimum is 22€ and the VAT rate 19%. So on a 41€ hoodie you'd pay 7,79€ VAT. xeqqone: Exactly ! I checked my country's custom website ( France ) as andiwouldwalk500more told me and indeed the VAT rate is 19% so 7,79€ , that's not too bad I guess :)

1891,e3lyt28,lilypichu,destiny defending lily and poki,"Zuggtmoy: ABATHUR get her on for a debate! ABATHUR r2002: &gt;Yeah for Lily... I can see that.

lol. Seriously though, I agree with Destiny that even if all the accusations are 1, so what? If one day Lily said ""oh yeah I sometimes fake my voice"" I'm not sure that would matter to me. Lily's a voice actress and she especially aspires to VA anime stuff. So if she often hams up the anime voice during stream I assume that is just her flexing her skills and demonstrating her range.

I've never heard her say anything sexual or inappropriate -- except to make Wendy uncomfortable ha ha. In fact if I have kids Lily's stream would be one of the few I would feel unconditionally comfortable letting them watch. Zuggtmoy: Imagine, for example, accusing voice actress of faking her voice LOOOOOOOL r2002: Next thing you're going to tell me is that Steven is not actually controlling intergalactic swarm of biological drones in an desperate war of domination versus an ancient race of psionic beings and platoons of cyberneticly enhanced humans. RiosCDN: When he said, oh wait, Poki is showing her feet in this pic, I guess that makes her a whore, I actually started laughing pretty hard. 

Seriously though I get the point she is trying to make but she doesn't make good points and has bad examples because she just wanted to attack big streamers instead of finding girls who actually do it and again with Destiny's point, who cares? Don't watch. lilypichu: Steven's cool ❤

In all seriousness though I've seen girls like this a lot. Trying to tear 0s down, make themselves look good, i.e. I'm not like the 0 uwu girls!! which is super hypocritical when you think about it. It's sad but I hope in the future she redirects her efforts into something less hateful and more productive. This is not a path she'll look back on and be proud of. 

The only point she kinda had was the zombi girl thingy, but we legit resolved that so many times through DMs and there's only so many times that same topic can be brought up. But that doesn't fit her narrative, so...  shunsui_sexton: She has taken the video down, i'm guessing she got a wave of dislikes. aznperson: you should draw whiteknight steven chibi for defending your honor (because it would trigger him) 

but yea it seems like she made the video to start drama or she has the Mitchjones syndrome where she thinks every except her her is fake  oriannaagrande: Its still there. Comments are just deleted. Odd considering she was so confident proving the “whiteknights” in the comments wrong &gt;.&gt; Masskid: &gt; ""As a high voiced girl who likes cute clothing""

Hates on 0 high voiced girls who likes clothing ._. jpmaaaaarx: Update: She either made the video private, or she removed it LUL.  porkboi: I'm late but DELET EmperorMagikarp: This is just a click bait video. What she is hoping for is bigger streamers/youtubers to talk about her, cause drama, and therefore garner her more views. I certainly didn't know about her before this. Talking about this type of content only feeds this type of content. Best to just walk away. I love Steven, he is a pretty funny dude, but he is giving her views. 

On a more personal note, it could be that she posted this because she is insecure about herself. She sees these big name streamers (who some might say she is similar to) get a lot of hate (because this is the internet and any idiot with an opinion will be heard by the masses) for basically just being themselves and making content people enjoy (Especially when it comes to her mentioning you, Poki, and Jaime [I don't think I know any of the 0 streamers/tubers] ). It is very possible that people give her a lot of hate for the same stuff. 

Rather than ignore the hate (I'm not saying it's easy, stuff gets to everyone sometimes), many people, such as this person, try to hop right on that hate train and blame the ""real problem"". Problem is, hopping on the hate train won't stop your haters. It will only attract more people who enjoy hopping on that hate train. A fanbase will become more and more toxic the longer people do this. It's generally not sustainable longterm, and it is extremely stressful to be around all that negativity.

I can see that.

lol. Seriously though, I agree with Destiny that even if all the accusations are 1, so what? If one day Lily said ""oh yeah I sometimes fake my voice"" I'm not sure that would matter to me. Lily's a voice actress and she especially aspires to VA anime stuff. So if she often hams up the anime voice during stream I assume that is just her flexing her skills and demonstrating her range.

I've never heard her say anything sexual or inappropriate -- except to make Wendy uncomfortable ha ha. In fact if I have kids Lily's stream would be one of the few I would feel unconditionally comfortable letting them watch. Zuggtmoy: Imagine, for example, accusing voice actress of faking her voice LOOOOOOOL r2002: Next thing you're going to tell me is that Steven is not actually controlling intergalactic swarm of biological drones in an desperate war of domination versus an ancient race of psionic beings and platoons of cyberneticly enhanced humans. RiosCDN: When he said, oh wait, Poki is showing her feet in this pic, I guess that makes her a whore, I actually started laughing pretty hard. 

Seriously though I get the point she is trying to make but she doesn't make good points and has bad examples because she just wanted to attack big streamers instead of finding girls who actually do it and again with Destiny's point, who cares? Don't watch. lilypichu: Steven's cool ❤

In all seriousness though I've seen girls like this a lot. Trying to tear 0s down, make themselves look good, i.e. I'm not like the 0 uwu girls!! which is super hypocritical when you think about it. It's sad but I hope in the future she redirects her efforts into something less hateful and more productive. This is not a path she'll look back on and be proud of. 

The only point she kinda had was the zombi girl thingy, but we legit resolved that so many times through DMs and there's only so many times that same topic can be brought up. But that doesn't fit her narrative, so...  shunsui_sexton: She has taken the video down, i'm guessing she got a wave of dislikes. aznperson: you should draw whiteknight steven chibi for defending your honor (because it would trigger him) 

but yea it seems like she made the video to start drama or she has the Mitchjones syndrome where she thinks every except her her is fake  oriannaagrande: Its still there. Comments are just deleted. Odd considering she was so confident proving the “whiteknights” in the comments wrong &gt;.&gt; Masskid: &gt; ""As a high voiced girl who likes cute clothing""

Hates on 0 high voiced girls who likes clothing ._. jpmaaaaarx: Update: She either made the video private, or she removed it LUL.  porkboi: I'm late but DELET EmperorMagikarp: This is just a click bait video.

* What's the most memorable moment that's happened to you during a stream? Slash508_: Would you ever play persona 5? AmeliaAddis0605: Who is your favorite bts band member Casseerole: What do you feel about the current state of MMOs as someone who grew up on them? Are there any you're particularly interested in trying? CamilliaFlowers: If you weren't streaming and with offline tv, what would you be doing right now?  Mia0605: What would you say to someone who wants to start streaming but are to scared to put themselves out there and of drama?  Clean_Paper: What is your favorite meme of all time? FireSt0rm9: You ever plan on continuing you Dark Souls 3 playthrough? I loved watching that. 😁 BlutigeBaumwolle: Any chance of a Nier Automata strim in the near future? Quasaru: Who are some of your favorite community artists and favorite fan art that you've enjoyed the most so far? Darkklaw: Hello! Please keep it to one question per person at a time! Xexanos: I remember that back in the day you rarely had a face cam in your streams and if you did you had some big sunglasses covering up your face.

What was it that made you overcome your shyness/insecurities? BlutigeBaumwolle: Oops. I removed one of them. Darkklaw: Thank you! Cpt_Barricade: if temmie could talk what voice would she have  iLuvwaffless: Hey Lily, as a long time viewer I really miss your piano compositions and I suppose this is more of a request rather than a question but would it be possible to upload some of your most recent songs up on youtube? (Meme things like joast theme song, destinys song, etc.) It seems that your youtube is mostly highlight from your stream but I think it would be great if we saw more music on there. Especially now that you can have albie collab with you. I really love when you two just jam out on stream and would love to have videos to listen to at will instead of having to hunt down vods. huyenlinh: who is your favourite influencer/content creator at the moment? (youtuber, streamer, VA, etc) Perpetualinvalidity: Hey!

The crisis line that I work for in MN is closing down. We used to handle all the mental health crisis and suicide line calls. I still really want to work in this area, so I'm thinking of starting a twitch channel based around playing some games and chatting with people who are going through some rough stuff, for support. What do you think of this idea? I would love opinions from 0s too. madforpeace: Hey Lily! I like your humor &amp; content! 
My question: who is your favorite youtuber?  Darkklaw: Since you would love opinions from 0s too:
It definitely sounds like an interesting idea, although it might attract a relatively niche audience and take a while to take off.

That said, I would suggest having a good look at the Twitch ToS. I don't know it in depth but I would not be surprised if some of the things in there might be relevant, even if only because of trolls this type of content might attract. Perpetualinvalidity: That is a very good idea. I also have my eyes on various HIPAA compliance and how that would work given that it's a public broadcast medium. louufy: What keeps you up at night?  UndyingNito: Hey Lily, what is your favourite thing to do in your freetime with temmie/offline tv members? 


P.S. I've enjoyed your content for a long time and it helped through darker times, thank you. VicKe63: Hey Lily! What countries do you want to visit in the future?

ALonleyRacoon: Did you ever expect being so famous with 1,000,000 fans? good_form_pupper: How well did you do in highschool Jelliots: Hey Lily, want you to know you're super entertaining and have inspired me to save money to buy a piano and learn how to play. My questions this: how do you like creating content for a living and being a part of a group like OfflineTV? It's my life goal to create videos and what not as a career.

i have a question, will u be going to crunchyroll expo? :o lilypichu: that's gonna be a big yikes from me dawg lilypichu: bunch of things. age, maturing, fixed my jaw, learned make up, more self confidence.  lilypichu: declining for sure, but I'd be open to trying mmos since they were a part of my childhood really. I liked maple story 2! lilypichu: annoying high pitched. hey kinda like her owner! c: lilypichu: when you start, your community will be super supportive. smaller communities are often like that. nothing to be scared of. If you're passionate about something, it will show. As for drama, that'll only really happen if you choose to involve yourself in such things OR you become big enough so that people make drama about you, in which case I'd consider that a win. lilypichu: nier is one of those games i keep saying i'll play soon but I keep holding off because I keep forgetting... LOL lilypichu: Honestly, if I could become a full time, professional voice actress, that'd be the dream. But I don't think I'll ever stop creating content naturally, whether it's art, music, or videos. Doesn't have to be for a living, but I think I'll still at least make stuff! lilypichu: AM I A GOOD OWNER

HaineBot: Lily, what are some of your favourite VA?  lilypichu: I love trying to teach Temmie new tricks, or just cuddling with her, playing with her, petting her, hugging her. I love her existence so much haha. I usually hang out in the living room and watch stuff with Fed, Albert or maybe Scarra once in a while. 

And I'm super happy to hear that. &lt;3 lilypichu: I'd love to visit Japan again. I also wanna visit Singapore!  lilypichu: jeez I don't know the thought depresses me. I genuinely don't know what I would be doing...  lilypichu: albie, temmie, friends, fans, art, music, good food, good company, accomplishments, voice acting :) lilypichu: I love it, I think I'm very fortunate and I'm constantly reminded of that every day. I hope you achieve your dreams as a content creator as well!  killerfrenzi: If you were able to interact and tell your past self about how you are doing now, how would past Lily of 3 and 5 years ago react? lilypichu: mostly just thinking about stuff. Random stuff. Life.  xmidn1ght: Are you ever going to come to Australia in Melbourne? GreenDaBean: Did you answer my good friend vinhtages question? It's around here somewhere and it'd nice if you did because he's somewhat insecure about himself and while I think that's due to the hyperbolized aggression from his peers I also think that it's due him feeling that he isn't heard. Hi vinh :) cdausch: What time do you usually go to sleep? TIWIMEISTER: Hey Lily, what are some genre's of music you'd like to indulge/interested in but never actually thoroughly checked out. Panzy7: Can't watch anime for your entire life or Can't see albert (even pictures or vids) for your entire life?  jpmaaaaarx: Hi Lily, what are your thoughts regarding clips from your stream being put into stream highlights/compilations videos? 

Was  just wondering because I just watched MagikarpUsedFly's old video about this and I know that there are streamers who dont like their stuff being put onto the said videos.

Also, JOAST is just a meme. spookyahoy: Do you ever miss home? BeekaChuuu: Hi lily I just wanted to say hi and that a lot of people have mistaken me for you in a lot of games that have voice chat in! I never really noticed that my voice sounds like you? But have always been watching since day 1! My question is what is your favourite Kpop group and why?  Ratix0: Come Singapore! We'd like to see you here :D. All the rhythm games are here too! Rhaidot: Do you like Noragami? I just discovered it recently. I knew of Yato as a meme, but I was actually surprised for the quality of the story and the fights were well done. looking forward to watch second season and hopefully the manga will have a proper ending after coming back from such long hiatus.

Lily, thanks for your content and keep going, try to have as much fun as you can because you deserve it :D UndyingNito: That is lovely, thank you for your answer and stay comfy.  Jelliots: &lt;3 xianaru: Heey Lily! :D Do you like drinking coffee (like Starbucks)? Azusalove: Out of curiosity, have you seen “Gakkou Gurashi!”? It’s an anime that I believe it would fit your tastes. 


Also if you haven’t seen it and decide to watch it, you need to go into it blind for the full experience. (:  justaprocrastinator: Do you think you'll do an0 ''if league of legends was an anime'' with RTB in the future? I really liked them rockstarpoe7: What's your favorite thing to do on lazy Saturday morning? reallynicememebuddy: Hi Lily! I feel like it's pretty common for people at the top of their field to feel a desire to move on to some kind of new challenge. It's pretty safe to say you've ""made it"" as a content creator, so do you ever get the urge to move on from what you're doing now and fully devote yourself to some 0 field? FeedyHS: Hi Lily, french fan here, just wanna ask, what's your opinion on Wrestling ? dareenc: Hey lily! If you had to eat one type of cuisine for the rest of your life, what would it be?

And then if you see an opportunity to collaborate, do so.  lilypichu: If her asks, certainly! lilypichu: Idk if I've ""made it"" but I still haven't stopped pursuing voice acting!

AmeliaAddis0605: Who is your favorite bts band member Casseerole: What do you feel about the current state of MMOs as someone who grew up on them? Are there any you're particularly interested in trying? CamilliaFlowers: If you weren't streaming and with offline tv, what would you be doing right now?  Mia0605: What would you say to someone who wants to start streaming but are to scared to put themselves out there and of drama?  Clean_Paper: What is your favorite meme of all time? FireSt0rm9: You ever plan on continuing you Dark Souls 3 playthrough? I loved watching that. 😁 BlutigeBaumwolle: Any chance of a Nier Automata strim in the near future? Quasaru: Who are some of your favorite community artists and favorite fan art that you've enjoyed the most so far? Darkklaw: Hello! Please keep it to one question per person at a time! Xexanos: I remember that back in the day you rarely had a face cam in your streams and if you did you had some big sunglasses covering up your face.

What was it that made you overcome your shyness/insecurities? BlutigeBaumwolle: Oops. I removed one of them. Darkklaw: Thank you! Cpt_Barricade: if temmie could talk what voice would she have  iLuvwaffless: Hey Lily, as a long time viewer I really miss your piano compositions and I suppose this is more of a request rather than a question but would it be possible to upload some of your most recent songs up on youtube? (Meme things like joast theme song, destinys song, etc.) It seems that your youtube is mostly highlight from your stream but I think it would be great if we saw more music on there. Especially now that you can have albie collab with you. I really love when you two just jam out on stream and would love to have videos to listen to at will instead of having to hunt down vods. huyenlinh: who is your favourite influencer/content creator at the moment? (youtuber, streamer, VA, etc) Perpetualinvalidity: Hey!

The crisis line that I work for in MN is closing down. We used to handle all the mental health crisis and suicide line calls. I still really want to work in this area, so I'm thinking of starting a twitch channel based around playing some games and chatting with people who are going through some rough stuff, for support. What do you think of this idea? I would love opinions from 0s too. madforpeace: Hey Lily! I like your humor &amp; content! 
My question: who is your favorite youtuber?  Darkklaw: Since you would love opinions from 0s too:
It definitely sounds like an interesting idea, although it might attract a relatively niche audience and take a while to take off.

That said, I would suggest having a good look at the Twitch ToS. I don't know it in depth but I would not be surprised if some of the things in there might be relevant, even if only because of trolls this type of content might attract. Perpetualinvalidity: That is a very good idea. I also have my eyes on various HIPAA compliance and how that would work given that it's a public broadcast medium. louufy: What keeps you up at night?  UndyingNito: Hey Lily, what is your favourite thing to do in your freetime with temmie/offline tv members?

Charge72002: What makes you happy? oppaniichan: Do you prefer persona Lily or irl-based Lily when it comes to fanart these days?  ALonleyRacoon: Did you ever expect being so famous with 1,000,000 fans? good_form_pupper: How well did you do in highschool Jelliots: Hey Lily, want you to know you're super entertaining and have inspired me to save money to buy a piano and learn how to play. My questions this: how do you like creating content for a living and being a part of a group like OfflineTV? It's my life goal to create videos and what not as a career. Silvertrials:  Would you give up streaming and producing content on Youtube for voice acting?  Anthuni: Why are you so perfect :(  acnehunter: are you d8ing abie?

But I don't think I'll ever stop creating content naturally, whether it's art, music, or videos. Doesn't have to be for a living, but I think I'll still at least make stuff! lilypichu: AM I A GOOD OWNER

HaineBot: Lily, what are some of your favourite VA?  lilypichu: I love trying to teach Temmie new tricks, or just cuddling with her, playing with her, petting her, hugging her. I love her existence so much haha. I usually hang out in the living room and watch stuff with Fed, Albert or maybe Scarra once in a while. 

And I'm super happy to hear that. &lt;3 lilypichu: I'd love to visit Japan again. I also wanna visit Singapore!  lilypichu: jeez I don't know the thought depresses me. I genuinely don't know what I would be doing...  lilypichu: albie, temmie, friends, fans, art, music, good food, good company, accomplishments, voice acting :) lilypichu: I love it, I think I'm very fortunate and I'm constantly reminded of that every day. I hope you achieve your dreams as a content creator as well!  killerfrenzi: If you were able to interact and tell your past self about how you are doing now, how would past Lily of 3 and 5 years ago react? lilypichu: mostly just thinking about stuff. Random stuff. Life.  xmidn1ght: Are you ever going to come to Australia in Melbourne? GreenDaBean: Did you answer my good friend vinhtages question? It's around here somewhere and it'd nice if you did because he's somewhat insecure about himself and while I think that's due to the hyperbolized aggression from his peers I also think that it's due him feeling that he isn't heard. Hi vinh :) cdausch: What time do you usually go to sleep? TIWIMEISTER: Hey Lily, what are some genre's of music you'd like to indulge/interested in but never actually thoroughly checked out. Panzy7: Can't watch anime for your entire life or Can't see albert (even pictures or vids) for your entire life?  jpmaaaaarx: Hi Lily, what are your thoughts regarding clips from your stream being put into stream highlights/compilations videos? 

Was  just wondering because I just watched MagikarpUsedFly's old video about this and I know that there are streamers who dont like their stuff being put onto the said videos.

Also, JOAST is just a meme. spookyahoy: Do you ever miss home? BeekaChuuu: Hi lily I just wanted to say hi and that a lot of people have mistaken me for you in a lot of games that have voice chat in! I never really noticed that my voice sounds like you? But have always been watching since day 1! My question is what is your favourite Kpop group and why?  Ratix0: Come Singapore! We'd like to see you here :D. All the rhythm games are here too! Rhaidot: Do you like Noragami? I just discovered it recently. I knew of Yato as a meme, but I was actually surprised for the quality of the story and the fights were well done. looking forward to watch second season and hopefully the manga will have a proper ending after coming back from such long hiatus.

Lily, thanks for your content and keep going, try to have as much fun as you can because you deserve it :D UndyingNito: That is lovely, thank you for your answer and stay comfy.  Jelliots: &lt;3 xianaru: Heey Lily! :D Do you like drinking coffee (like Starbucks)? Azusalove: Out of curiosity, have you seen “Gakkou Gurashi!”? It’s an anime that I believe it would fit your tastes. 


Also if you haven’t seen it and decide to watch it, you need to go into it blind for the full experience. (:  justaprocrastinator: Do you think you'll do an0 ''if league of legends was an anime'' with RTB in the future? I really liked them rockstarpoe7: What's your favorite thing to do on lazy Saturday morning? reallynicememebuddy: Hi Lily! I feel like it's pretty common for people at the top of their field to feel a desire to move on to some kind of new challenge. It's pretty safe to say you've ""made it"" as a content creator, so do you ever get the urge to move on from what you're doing now and fully devote yourself to some 0 field? FeedyHS: Hi Lily, french fan here, just wanna ask, what's your opinion on Wrestling ? dareenc: Hey lily! If you had to eat one type of cuisine for the rest of your life, what would it be?

 [Free Test](http://similarminds.com/advtest.html) - It's important to note that your answers should be almost instant and based on your first gut feeling to the question. Don't think and talk yourself into changing your answer.

 [Ennegram Institute](https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/) - There is a paid test here that I recommend taking if you are genuinely interested, be warned that it is quite long. 0wise this is a great website to read up about your type and wing.

 [Structural Ennegram](https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/) - Good website with a slight spin on types and wings. An0 good place to read up results on your types.

 [A good read about the ennegram](https://www.amazon.com/Whats-Point-Enneagram-Justin-Tomasino/dp/1591093481) - Dr.Tomasino does a great job of explaining the enneagram and helping you understand just what type might mean or dispel something you've heard about them.

 [Pre-set Amazon search for high rating and prime shipping](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=sr_nr_p_72_0?fst=as%3Aoff&amp;rh=n%3A283155%2Ck%3Aenneagram%2Cp_85%3A2470955011%2Cp_72%3A1250221011&amp;keywords=enneagram&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1516855231&amp;rnid=1250219011) - Any of the first two pages are great reads, however they tend to lean towards a ""self help"" style of writing rather than an informational read.



* After taking the test feel free to read up about your personality type but don't get hung up on what it says. A Type 1 is generally known as the Perfectionist, however if they become stressed and devolve towards an unhealthy state they may become anything but perfectionists or even shift temporarily into a 4.
* Likewise, a 5 (the thinker) is generally associated with a loner or someone who isn't very social. If they shift towards a healthier state it's not impossible that they become more extroverted with their ideas and interact more with people.
* The system will seem shallow. Someone is vain and a drama queen, must be a 4. Party animal? 7. Fear of everything? 6! It actually gets fairly in-depth. You may be able to get a read on what somebody's likely type is however there is quite a bit to dig into and learn about once you hit that point.
* Have fun with it! The system is not some absolute categorization system that everybody will adhere to. It is however a good tool to learn about yourself, 0s and most importantly how to interact with people. The system excels in teaching you how 0 types think and how to interact with them, either to avoid conflict or to settle conflict by understand their thought process. kingdomgoddamncome: I wonder whatlilypichu 's enneagram tritype would be *thinking* al3xt33: (this reply's 169 days late, but idc lol)

Natsume's Book of Friends (slice of life/supernatural - nice chill but interesting), Flying Witch (same as above), Inari Kon Kon (cute as hell, lil bit more action), the Dam Keeper Poems, recently been watching  Kakuriyo no Yadomeshi

But yeah it is my favourite shoogoawayihateu: A really popular one if you like you’re a fantasy type of guy is spirited away but it’s a movie not a series MusicalAmbition: Ohboyohboyohboy YES

Romance: Toradora, Clannad, and Anohana

Comedy/SOL: Girls last tour, Kobayashi Dragon Maid, Plastic Memories, Angel Beats, Blend S, and Gabriel Dropout

Action: FMAB and Hunter x hunter






Edit: I FORGOT TO MENTION K-ON AND SHIGATSU jpmaaaaarx: Your Lie in April, Violet Evergarden, Hinamatsuri. All of these are quality comedy anime ;w; AdamC90: If you’re just starting, I recommend Death Note, Tokyo Ghoul, Code Geass, Seven Deadly Sins, Fullmetal Alchemist and Psycho-Pass.

They’re all mainstream, but super entertaining.   aneutron: Oh stop it you, quietly sliding Angel Beats into Comedy. You cheeky bugger. poisonedrainbows: where's lily i want some of her recommendations ;-; genji2056: Replace toradora with Koi to Uso and you e got a list that's 10x better nilez_13: Now that's a unpopular opinion  nilez_13: Watch her favourite anime : Madoka Magica  genji2056: Toradora as an anime was unpleasant personally. The light novel was a much better. BlutigeBaumwolle: the world would be a better place if everyone watched mob psycho 100 Omi_Omicronic: Baka and Test babyyyy nilez_13: Haven't really read the LN but torodora was much better than koi to uso for me and most people but every has their own preferences. genji2056: Agreed. nilez_13: You'll literally be left in tears eh?  masiju: * **neon genesis evangelion** (Action, mech, psychological) 26 episodes + **End of Evangelion** movie
